Camping is permitted at Punalu'u Black Sand Beach Park, though in recent years the campground has been patronized by those wishing to engage in more tomfoolery (and sometimes disruption of the habits of the [[sea turtles]] that frequent Punalu'u) than recreation, making the park difficult to enjoy on the weekends.

The area where you swim has some larger rocks in it.  Also the beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it.  This fresh water is very cold (you can get chills when you swim in it)and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water.  Legend has it that in the time of drought the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get there fresh water.

'''Punalu'u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Naalehu, Hawaii]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]] that has black sand created by volcanic activity.  This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]]. Taking black sand is prohibited, but, like volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu'u Beach is taken away from Hawaii that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu'u Black Sand Beach Park.

The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim. Also the beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

Punalu'u is frequented by large [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times.

There has been recent controversy over the area because of a proposed development by a Beverly Hills devolopment, Sea Mountain V, that is planning a massive luxury resort.  The resort would include 1,800 luxury housing units, a luxury hotel, and a major shopping complex.  Many of the local residents as well as outsiders do not support this development because it threatens to destroy the rural community by the introduction of rich vacationers, marginalization of the local residents by providing them with menial, low-income employment, and most importantly, building on the longest, untouched and pristine coastline in the state of Hawai'i.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu'u Beach is taken away from Hawaii that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu'u Black Sand Beach Park, though in recent years the campground has been patronized by ne'er-do-wells wishing to engage in more tomfoolery (including the disruption of the habits of the [[sea turtles]] that frequent Punalu'u) than recreation, making the park difficult to enjoy on the weekends.

The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim. Also the beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

Punalu'u is frequented by large [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times.

There has been recent controversy over the area because of a proposed development by a Beverly Hills devolopment, Sea Mountain V, that is planning a massive luxury resort.  The resort would include 1,800 luxury housing units, a luxury hotel, and a major shopping complex.  Many of the local residents as well as outsiders do not support this development because it threatens to destroy the rural community by the introduction of rich vacationers, marginalization of the local residents by providing them with menial, low-income employment, and most importantly, building on the longest, untouched and pristine coastline in the state of Hawai'i.

==Development==

There has been recent controversy in the area because of a proposed redevelopment of the decaying infrastructure. Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. Most Punalu'u residents support this project due to the dire need to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.  Sea Mountain at Punalu‘u will create an environmentally sensitive complex committed to economic revitalization for the people of Ka‘ū, and the environmental protection for the land and ocean.


This renewed vision of Sea Mountain complex will revitalize the current deteriorated, dilapidated infrastructure at Punalu‘u, refreshing and enhancing the 434-acre area between Pahala and Na‘alehu that currently is home to rotting buildings and failing infrastructure, including the 30-year-old sewer system that is &quot;marginally adequate&quot; according to recent assessments and the inadequate water system that serves more than 100 households at Punalu‘u.  In addition, the project is expected to bring 517 permanent, new jobs to the area, as well as create $735 million in economic input and $342 million in new household income for this area in desperate need of assistance, where most people spend between four and seven hours a day in transit to find work in Kona or Hilo.


Sea  Mountain V also has offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a Shoreline Preservation Area that will Deed Restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed in the shoreline area except those shown on the shoreline plan, preserving the shoreline forever.  This area will encompass approximately 56 acres of shoreline.


Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 units total (combined hotel and residential) with no more than 350 of those units being hotel units spread over a 434-acre area.  One of those hotels will be a small, eco-hotel with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. New entry points will be added to the ocean, to enhance the local residents’ ability to access the ocean that is so integral to life in the area.  New public amenities will be built for the local residents, including a refurbished boat dock, restrooms, and walking trails. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka‘ū, as well as a Community Benefits Package, that would provide millions of dollars to the community over the life of the project.  This money would benefit the hospital, the schools and other local institutions or groups that work to benefit the community.


Because of the partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] and Ocean Futures Society, the development will bring new programs for the children of the Punalu‘u, including [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]’s famous Ambassadors of the Environment program, which provides students from 7 – 17 a chance to learn more about the local environment and ways to conserve this precious resource. Ocean Futures Society has offered to present ongoing educational lectures and seminars at Ka‘ū High School as well. With Ocean Futures Society, the development will ensure the project is good for Hawaii’s environment. [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] embarked on a similar program in Fiji, which Conde Nast Travel Magazine named the Jean-Michel Cousteau Fiji Island Resort as the top eco-resort in the world in 2005. [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] has developed protection projects for sustainable reefs in America Samoa, and hopes to establish a similar program at Sea Mountain at Punalu’u.  For example, his Ocean Futures Society hopes to develop a protection program for the Hawaiian green sea turtle and the Hawksbill  turtle, to help these animals flourish.  By creating marine preservation programs, [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] and Ocean Futures Society will be able to attract world-class marine scientists to help study and preserve the ocean as it was.

'''Punalu'u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Naalehu, Hawaii]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity.  This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu'u is frequented by large [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu'u Beach is taken away from Hawaii that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu'u Black Sand Beach Park, though in recent years the campground has been patronized by disorderly visitors known for bothering the [[sea turtles]] that frequent Punalu'u), making the park difficult to enjoy on the weekends.

The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim. Also the beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Development==

There is discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the decaying infrastructure currently serving Punalu‘u.  Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. Most Punalu'u residents support this project due to the dire need to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.  Sea Mountain at Punalu‘u will create an environmentally sensitive complex committed to economic revitalization for the people of Ka‘ū, and the environmental protection for the land and ocean.


This renewed vision of Sea Mountain complex will revitalize the current deteriorated, dilapidated infrastructure at Punalu‘u, refreshing and enhancing the 434-acre area between Pahala and Na‘alehu that currently is home to rotting buildings and failing infrastructure, including the 30-year-old sewer system that is &quot;marginally adequate&quot; according to recent assessments and the inadequate water system that serves more than 100 households at Punalu‘u.  In addition, the project is expected to bring 517 permanent, new jobs to the area, as well as create $735 million in economic input and $342 million in new household income for this area in desperate need of assistance, where most people spend between four and seven hours a day in transit to find work in Kona or Hilo.


Sea  Mountain V also has offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a Shoreline Preservation Area that will Deed Restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed in the shoreline area except those shown on the shoreline plan, preserving the shoreline forever.  This area will encompass approximately 56 acres of shoreline.


Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 units total (combined hotel and residential) with no more than 350 of those units being hotel units spread over a 434-acre area.  One of those hotels will be a small, eco-hotel with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. New entry points will be added to the ocean, to enhance the local residents’ ability to access the ocean that is so integral to life in the area.  New public amenities will be built for the local residents, including a refurbished boat dock, restrooms, and walking trails. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka‘ū, as well as a Community Benefits Package, that would provide millions of dollars to the community over the life of the project.  This money would benefit the hospital, the schools and other local institutions or groups that work to benefit the community.i am hella sexy


Because of the partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] and Ocean Futures Society, the development will bring new programs for the children of the Punalu‘u, including [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]’s famous Ambassadors of the Environment program, which provides students from 7 – 17 a chance to learn more about the local environment and ways to conserve this precious resource. Ocean Futures Society has offered to present ongoing educational lectures and seminars at Ka‘ū High School as well. With Ocean Futures Society, the development will ensure the project is good for Hawaii’s environment. [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] embarked on a similar program in Fiji, which Conde Nast Travel Magazine named the Jean-Michel Cousteau Fiji Island Resort as the top eco-resort in the world in 2005. [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] has developed protection projects for sustainable reefs in America Samoa, and hopes to establish a similar program at Sea Mountain at Punalu’u.  For example, his Ocean Futures Society hopes to develop a protection program for the Hawaiian green sea turtle and the Hawksbill  turtle, to help these animals flourish.  By creating marine preservation programs, [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] and Ocean Futures Society will be able to attract world-class marine scientists to help study and preserve the ocean as it was.

Ocean Futures Society has offered to present ongoing educational lectures and seminars at Ka‘ū High School as well. With Ocean Futures Society, the development will ensure the project is good for Hawaii’s environment. [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] embarked on a similar program in Fiji, which Conde Nast Travel Magazine named the Jean-Michel Cousteau Fiji Island Resort as the top eco-resort in the world in 2005. [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] has developed protection projects for sustainable reefs in America Samoa, and hopes to establish a similar program at Sea Mountain at Punalu’u.  For example, his Ocean Futures Society hopes to develop a protection program for the Hawaiian green sea turtle and the Hawksbill  turtle, to help these animals flourish.  By creating marine preservation programs, [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] and Ocean Futures Society will be able to attract world-class marine scientists to help study and preserve the ocean as it was.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by large [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V has stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Sea Mountain V has also offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s. However, others in the area oppose this project becuase they believe that it will significantly damage the environment.

Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahala (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by large [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered Species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea and honu, Hawaiian monk seal, native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other anchialine pond fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered Hawaiian hawk ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. The reconnaissance survey team observed spinner dolphins and humpback whales offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals

The honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the Hawaiian Islands, more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened green sea turtle or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered Hawaiian Hoary Bat , ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The hoary bat's habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.  

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Ponds==
Anchialine (near the sea) pools of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellow fin tuna and mackerel. In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protien. 

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V has stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Sea Mountain V has also offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s. However, others in the area oppose this project becuase they believe that it will significantly damage the environment.

Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered Species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea and honu, Hawaiian monk seal, native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other anchialine pond fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered Hawaiian hawk ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. The reconnaissance survey team observed spinner dolphins and humpback whales offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals

The honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the Hawaiian Islands, more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened green sea turtle or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered Hawaiian Hoary Bat , ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The hoary bat's habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.  

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Ponds==
Anchialine (near the sea) pools of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellow fin tuna and mackerel. In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protien. 

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V has stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Sea Mountain V has also offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s. However, others in the area oppose this project becuase they believe that it will significantly damage the environment.

Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered Species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea and honu, Hawaiian monk seal, native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other anchialine pond fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered Hawaiian hawk ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. The reconnaissance survey team observed spinner dolphins and humpback whales offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals

The honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the Hawaiian Islands, more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened green sea turtle or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered Hawaiian Hoary Bat , ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The hoary bat's habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.  

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellow fin tuna and mackerel. In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protien. 

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V has stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Sea Mountain V has also offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s. However, others in the area oppose this project becuase they believe that it will significantly damage the environment.

Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including yellow fin tuna and mackerel. In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked taro and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protien. 

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V hopes to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V has stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Sea Mountain V has also offered to donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s. However, others in the area oppose this project becuase they believe that it will significantly damage the environment.

Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered Species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Green Sea Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellow fin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V in consultancy with [http://www.group70int.com Group 70 International, Inc.] hope to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V, and it's consultants [http://www.group70int.com Group 70 International, Inc.] have stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Sea Mountain V, owners and leaseholders of the County of Hawaii's beach park at Punalu{{okina}}u, has stated it would donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s. However, others in the area oppose this project becuase they believe that it will significantly damage the environment.

Through collaborative conversations with the community in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered Species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Green Sea Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

The County of Hawaii, and it's Finance Committee, has recently held public hearings to gauge  public sentiment regarding the feasibility of acquiring 150-acres of land in the area of the current beach park through Hawaii County's 2% Land Acquisition Fund, and with matching Federal Funding earmarked toward the land acquisition through legislation introduced by US Congresswoman [[Mazie Hirono]].

Some people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support this project due to the desire to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.

The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellow fin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V in consultancy with [http://www.group70int.com Group 70 International, Inc.] hope to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V and [http://www.group70int.com Group 70 International, Inc.] have stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Through collaborative conversations with a single community group - O Ka'u Kakou - in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

Sea Mountain V, owners and leaseholders of the County of Hawaii's beach park at Punalu{{okina}}u, has stated it would donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

The County of Hawaii, and it's Finance Committee, has recently held public hearings to gauge  public sentiment regarding the feasibility of acquiring 150-acres of land in the area of the current beach park through Hawaii County's 2% Land Acquisition Fund, and with matching Federal Funding earmarked toward the land acquisition through legislation introduced by US Congresswoman [[Mazie Hirono]].

Most people in the Punalu{{okina}}u area support the land acquisition and preservation of the significantly cultural and pristine beach area, while others support the Sea Mountain V/Group 70 International project, seeking to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] that has [[black sand]] created by volcanic activity. This occurs when the lava flows into the ocean and explodes when it cools as it hits the ocean. The volcanic activity is now in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.

Taking black sand is prohibited but, as with volcanic rocks, local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. Camping is permitted at Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

The beach has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. 

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u: The Sacred Sites of Punalu`u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered Species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Green Sea Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.

The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Pools, Ponds, and Estuaries==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 


==Punalu`u’s Anchialine Pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa – Fish Houses==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellow fin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership of Ponds==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==

There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V in consultancy with [http://www.group70int.com Group 70 International, Inc.] hope to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V and [http://www.group70int.com Group 70 International, Inc.] have stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Through collaborative conversations with a single community group - O Ka'u Kakou - in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

Sea Mountain V, owners and leaseholders of the County of Hawaii's beach park at Punalu{{okina}}u, has stated it would donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

The County of Hawaii, and it's Finance Committee, has recently held public hearings to gauge  public sentiment regarding the feasibility of acquiring 150-acres of land in the area of the current beach park through Hawaii County's 2% Land Acquisition Fund, and with matching Federal Funding earmarked toward the land acquisition through legislation introduced by US Congresswoman [[Mazie Hirono]].

The community group [http://www.kaupreservation.org Ka'u Preservation]and its membership and others support the land acquisition proposal and preservation of Punalu{{okina}}u's significantly cultural areas and pristine beach area, while the community group O Ka'u Kakou and its membership and others support the Sea Mountain V/Group 70 International project, seeking to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.  Local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, then the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned.{{fact|date=June 2007}} Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==
[[Image:Punaluu_Black_Sand_Beach.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach &lt;small&gt;(Photo: [http://kenya.allmond.us Kenya Allmond])&lt;/small&gt;]]
Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Green Sea Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.

It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellow fin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==
{{POV-check-section}}
There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V in consultancy with Group 70 International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.group70int.com &lt;/ref&gt; hope to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V and Group 70 International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.group70int.com&lt;/ref&gt; have stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Through collaborative conversations with a single community group - O Ka'u Kakou - in 2005 and 2006, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū.

Sea Mountain V, owners and leaseholders of the County of Hawaii's beach park at Punalu{{okina}}u, has stated it would donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan.

The County of Hawaii, and it's Finance Committee, has recently held public hearings to gauge  public sentiment regarding the feasibility of acquiring 150-acres of land in the area of the current beach park through Hawaii County's 2% Land Acquisition Fund, and with matching Federal Funding earmarked toward the land acquisition through legislation introduced by US Congresswoman [[Mazie Hirono]].

The community group Ka'u Preservation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaupreservation.org &lt;/ref&gt; and its membership and others support the land acquisition proposal and preservation of Punalu{{okina}}u's significantly cultural areas and pristine beach area, while the community group O Ka'u Kakou and its membership and others support the Sea Mountain V/Group 70 International project, seeking to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.  Local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, then the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned.{{fact|date=June 2007}} Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==
[[Image:Punaluu_Black_Sand_Beach.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach &lt;small&gt;(Photo: [http://kenya.allmond.us Kenya Allmond])&lt;/small&gt;]]

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Hawksbill Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.

Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellow fin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

==Development==
{{POV-check-section}}
There is an ongoing discussion of a proposed redevelopment of the infrastructure currently serving Punalu{{okina}}u. Sea Mountain V in consultancy with Group 70 International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.group70int.com &lt;/ref&gt; hope to bring new jobs, new job training, and a partnership with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org] for marine and land protection programs. 

Sea Mountain V and Group 70 International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.group70int.com&lt;/ref&gt; have stated that the complex will be environmentally friendly, and that the proposed Sea Mountain complex will renew the current infrastructure at Punalu{{okina}}u, enhancing the area between Pahala and Nā{{okina}}ālehu. Through collaborative conversations with first an advisory community group in 2005 and 2006 (that broke off to create their own independent community group, O Ka{{okina}}ū Kakou), and later with talks with the Ka{{okina}}ū Hawaiian Civic Club, Ka{{okina}}ū Rural Health and others, the revised development is scaled significantly back from the original proposal. Today’s development calls for 1,400 total hotel and residential units spread over a 434-acre area. All buildings will be pushed far back from the shoreline, between 300 and 600 feet off the beach. In addition, the developer is working with community to create a Cultural Center for the region of Ka{{okina}}ū, and to preserve culturally significant sites. The proposal will work closely to create land and marine protection programs and children's educational programs with [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]'s Ocean Futures Society [http://www.oceanfutures.org]. In June 2007, Ocean Futures Society held the first Ambassadors of the Environment camps in Punalu{{okina}}u, free to the children of Ka{{okina}}ū.

Sea Mountain V, owners and leaseholders of the County of Hawaii's beach park at Punalu{{okina}}u, has stated it would donate land to create a 17-acre park, as well as create a shoreline preservation area for a total of 56 acres that will restrict the designated shoreline area so no buildings will be allowed except those shown on the shoreline plan. In addition, Sea Mountain Five expects to create 517 new jobs and 3,800 person years of employment in Ka{{okina}}ū, as well as $735 million in economic input and $342 million in new household income through the project.  Sea Mountain Five's plan also will fix the infrastructure serving more than 100 residences in Punalu{{okina}}u, including the sewer system which has been rated &quot;marginally adequate&quot; and the water system which is not up to par.

The County of Hawaii, and it's Finance Committee, after hearing much debate over a resolution put forth by Council Member Bob Jacobson (Resolution 169-07), held a public hearing on June 4, 2007 to gauge public sentiment regarding the feasibility of acquiring 150-acres of land in the area of the current beach park through Hawaii County's 2% Land Acquisition Fund, and with matching Federal Funding earmarked toward the land acquisition through legislation introduced by US Congresswoman [[Mazie Hirono]]. 

The community group Ka'u Preservation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kaupreservation.org &lt;/ref&gt; and its membership and others support the land acquisition proposal and preservation of Punalu{{okina}}u's significantly cultural areas and pristine beach area, while the community group O Ka{{okina}}ū Kakou (We are Ka{{okina}}ū), the Ka{{okina}}ū Hawaiian Civic Club, Ka{{okina}}ū Rural Health and the Ka{{okina}}ū Chamber of Commerce and its membership and others support the Sea Mountain V/Group 70 International project, seeking to bring a new economic driver to the area, which began to decline with the closing of the sugar plantations in the 1980s and 90s.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.  Local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, then the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned.{{fact|date=June 2007}} Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==
[[Image:Punaluu_Black_Sand_Beach.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach &lt;small&gt;(Photo: [http://kenya.allmond.us Kenya Allmond])&lt;/small&gt;]]

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Hawksbill Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary Bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

The [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the [[anchialine pool]]s while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. [[Anchialine pool]]s are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known [[anchialine pool]]s, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellow fin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.  Local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, then the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned.{{fact|date=June 2007}} Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrafice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a [[Hawaiian monk seal]] was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The [[Hawksbill Turtle]], or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]]s habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.

The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.  Local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, then the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned.{{fact|date=June 2007}} Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.  

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{fact}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.  

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach''' is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.  

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.  

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] )and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.

In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.  

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]. 

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}  

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} 

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.  

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east - home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered, to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not faired as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including, Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau, likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf/warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings. 

Please kokua: While visiting Hawaiian wahi pana or sacred spaces please keep in mind that many wahi pana are still being used today by native Hawaiians.  Treat them with the reverence due any sacred site – modern or ancient.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricate) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau. 

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited. 

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island. 

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach near [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

[[Image:Green turtles Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]]s are basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==
[[Image:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]] is basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

[[Image:Green turtles Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]]s are basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==
[[Image:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]] is basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

[[Image:Green turtles Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Green Sea Turtle]]s basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==
[[Image:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]] is basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand ifrom Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is ala kahakai (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. A path with divine origins, the ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka`u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail by President Clinton in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Ownership==
The Civil Code of the Hawaiian kingdom did not allow the sale of fishponds or wetlands as these were resources of the common people.  After 1850, when the Hawaiian government began selling land, the Privy Council refused to permit any fishponds to be sold.  They were all reserved for the government, to be used by the people.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]] is basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] comprised of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu‘u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu`u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu`u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu`u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu`u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]] is basking on Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Nā'ālehu, Hawai'i|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times. The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of [[Pele (mythology)|this myth]]; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawai'ian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua Kona]], Hawai'i.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu'u==

Punalu`u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali`i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of Ka`u’s ancient feudal society.  With the advent of Missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka`u. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu`u is the Opukahaia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built on the birthplace of Henry Opukahaia (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawai`i.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu`u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about A.D. 1100 and Punalu`u is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka`ie`ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka`ie`ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous `ie`ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka`ie`ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu`u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu`u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu`u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu`u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki‘i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu`u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ('io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu`u in Sept. of 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu`u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or honu ea (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai‘i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai‘i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu‘u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu at Punalu‘u since 1982 along with groups of Hawai‘i students.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], ‘ope‘ape‘a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu`u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u_Beach_Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of Pele myth; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawaiian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali{{okina}}i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous {{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain ofKa{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau has not fared as well.  Heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u_Beach_Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawai‘i Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green Sea Turtle]] is basking on the beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]]s and [[Green Sea Turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of Pele myth; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawaiian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large heiau complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na ali{{okina}}i (the Chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of missionaries arriving in the district as early as 1833, Christianity left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole fishponds to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na `ili`ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous {{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain ofKa{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na kahuna (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to Puna.  This trail once paved with the `ili`ili hanau, (birthing stones) was designated as a National Historic Trail in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka`ie`ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku (petroglyphs) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked”
ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill Turtle]] ) and honu ([[Green Sea Turtle]]), [[Hawaiian monk seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu`u. [[Spinner dolphin]]s and [[humpback whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu‘u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian monk seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered [[Hawksbill Turtle]] (honu ea) are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[green sea turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain 15 feet (4½ m) from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (Lasirus cinereus semotus), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. The Hawaiian Hoary bats habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (Megalagrion xanthomelas) can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu‘apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā‘a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu‘apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of estuarine marshes, at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā‘a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of pāhoehoe (smooth, ropy lava), and ‘a‘ā flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrubforms and the invasive aquatic water hyacinth.  Native plants such as naupaka kahakai, ‘ilima ku kahakai, and pöhuehue. were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest spring complex on Hawai‘i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu`u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā‘a to Honu‘apo, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized brackish waters along coastal lava flows that exhibit tidal fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed lava tubes, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, by habitat loss due to coastal development, and by other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa  cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeqc.doh.hawaii.gov/Shared%20Documents/EA_and_EIS_Online_Library/Hawaii/1980s/1988-04-HA-FEIS-PUNALUU-RESORT-VOL-1.pdf |title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Punalu{{okina}}u Resort Volume I |work=state of Hawaii web site |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=April 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was partially built but abandoned.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.

The varied habitats of [[Lava#pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeqc.doh.hawaii.gov/Shared%20Documents/EA_and_EIS_Online_Library/Hawaii/1980s/1988-04-HA-FEIS-PUNALUU-RESORT-VOL-1.pdf |title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Punalu{{okina}}u Resort Volume I |work=state of Hawaii web site |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=April 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was partially built but abandoned.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green turtle]] basking on the beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of Pele myth; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawaiian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park|Pu{{okina}}uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792-1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii.

Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==

A larger resort was proposed in 1986.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green turtle]] basking on the beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of Pele myth; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawaiian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park|Pu{{okina}}uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area.

==Wetlands==

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of Pele myth; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawaiian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park|Pu{{okina}}uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeqc.doh.hawaii.gov/Shared%20Documents/EA_and_EIS_Online_Library/Hawaii/1980s/1988-04-HA-FEIS-PUNALUU-RESORT-VOL-1.pdf |title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Punalu{{okina}}u Resort Volume I |work=state of Hawaii web site |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=April 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was partially built but abandoned.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Taking black sand and volcanic rocks from the area is prohibited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}
[[File:Black Sand Beach big island Hawaii 1959.JPG|thumb|left|Beach in Oct. 1959]]
Local tradition says that if any volcanic rock or black sand from Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is taken away from Hawai{{okina}}i, that the person that took it will be cursed by the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] until it is returned. While purportedly an ancient Hawaiian belief, historians can trace this legend only to the mid twentieth century, and it is widely believed to have been invented by park rangers to keep visitors from taking rocks. Nevertheless, the lobby of Kīlauea Military Camp (now a vacation area for military personnel) has a cabinet displaying rocks returned by people attempting to atone for the bad luck that has befallen them, and letters describing their predicaments.

[[Russ Apple]] may have been the originator of Pele myth; as National Park Service Pacific historian and 30 year veteran of the [[National Park Service]], Apple was instrumental in restoring Hawaiian cultural resources in Kīlauea and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park|Pu{{okina}}uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to Sea Mountain Resort.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==

A larger resort was proposed in 1986.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called Black Sand Beach) is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the early Hawaiians living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools.

Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water.

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of na [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (chiefs) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane`ele`ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered honu ea are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle, or ''honu ea'' (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], more than 90% of honu ea nests are found on the Big Island.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting honu ea in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.  The shoreline should be considered a critical and ecologically significant nesting coastline for honu ea.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline.  Punalu{{okina}}u is an especially well known site for honu.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the honu flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the honu here since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the [[ancient Hawaii]]ans living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the [[Hawaiian language]] ''puna lu{{okina}}u'' means &quot;spring [water] diver for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Punalu'u |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[Missionary|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting high on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered Hawksbill turtles are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting Hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punalu{{okina}}u.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the Green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the Green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.

The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==

Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Hōkūloa |q=Hokuloa |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered Hawksbill turtles are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting Hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punalu{{okina}}u.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the Green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the Green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green turtle]] basking on the beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.  

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the [[ancient Hawaii]]ans living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the [[Hawaiian language]] ''puna lu{{okina}}u'' means &quot;spring [water] diver for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Punalu'u |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Hōkūloa |q=Hokuloa |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the [[ancient Hawaii]]ans living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the [[Hawaiian language]] ''puna lu{{okina}}u'' means &quot;spring [water] diver for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Punalu'u |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Hōkūloa |q=Hokuloa |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered Hawksbill turtles are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting Hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punalu{{okina}}u.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the Green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the Green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been know for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeqc.doh.hawaii.gov/Shared%20Documents/EA_and_EIS_Online_Library/Hawaii/1980s/1988-04-HA-FEIS-PUNALUU-RESORT-VOL-1.pdf |title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Punalu{{okina}}u Resort Volume I |work=state of Hawaii web site |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=April 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was partially built but abandoned.

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the [[ancient Hawaii]]ans living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the [[Hawaiian language]] ''puna lu{{okina}}u'' means &quot;spring [water] diver for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Punalu'u |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; hawaii is beautiful

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Hōkūloa |q=Hokuloa |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered Hawksbill turtles are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting Hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punalu{{okina}}u.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the Green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the Green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been known for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeqc.doh.hawaii.gov/Shared%20Documents/EA_and_EIS_Online_Library/Hawaii/1980s/1988-04-HA-FEIS-PUNALUU-RESORT-VOL-1.pdf |title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Punalu{{okina}}u Resort Volume I |work=state of Hawaii web site |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=April 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was partially built but abandoned.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green turtle]] basking on the beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered Hawksbill turtles are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting Hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punalu{{okina}}u.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the Green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the Green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola sericea|sericea]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been known for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

[[File:Green turtle Chelonia mydas is basking on Punaluu Beach Big Island of Hawaii.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[Green turtle]] basking on the beach]]

'''Punalu{{okina}}u Beach''' (also called '''Black Sand Beach''') is a beach between [[Pāhala, Hawai'i|Pāhala]] and [[Naalehu, Hawaii|Nā{{okina}}ālehu]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]].  The beach has [[black sand]] made of [[basalt]] and created by lava flowing into the ocean which explodes as it reaches the ocean and cools. This volcanic activity is in the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]].
Punalu{{okina}}u is frequented by endangered [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green turtle]]s, which can often be seen basking on the black sand.

==The beach==
The swimming area is very rocky, and it can be dangerous to swim.   The beach also has a large amount of underground fresh water that flows in it. This fresh water is very cold and looks almost like gasoline mixing with the water. Legend has it that in the time of drought, the [[ancient Hawaii]]ans living in the area would dive underwater with a jug to get their fresh water. In the [[Hawaiian language]] ''puna lu{{okina}}u'' means &quot;spring [water] diver for&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Punalu'u |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The beach is located at coordinates {{coord|19.136|N|155.504|W| display=inline,title| type:landmark_region:US-HI}}. Access is from the [[Hawaii Belt Road]]: take Ninole loop road or the entrance to the Sea Mountain Resort.
Camping is permitted at the Punalu{{okina}}u Black Sand Beach Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/planning/spa/kau/map2.html |title=Ka{{okina}}ū map |work=Shoreline access |publisher=on official Hawai{{okina}}i County web site |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahi Pana O Punalu{{okina}}u==

Punalu{{okina}}u and adjacent areas provide evidence of the shifts in use of sacred space over time.  Monumental architecture in the form of large [[heiau]] complexes (ritual centers) speak to the power of the [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]] (ruling class) and the social stratification of the ancient [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]].  With the advent of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries]] arriving in the district as early as 1833, [[Christianity]] left its distinct architectural hallmark on the landscape of Ka{{okina}}ū. Sitting on the ridge above Punalu{{okina}}u is the Hōkūloa Church, a Memorial Chapel and graveyard built near the birthplace of [[Henry Opukahaia|Henry {{okina}}Ōpūkaha{{okina}}ia]] (1792–1818) who inspired the missionary movement that forever changed Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Hōkūloa |q=Hokuloa |dic=cl |accessdate= November 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three pre-contact heiau within the immediate vicinity of Punalu{{okina}}u. The walled heiau was introduced to Hawaii about 1100 and Punalu{{okina}}uu is one of the last places in Hawaii where one can enjoy an unaltered view from one heiau to the next.

To the south lies Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie Heiau.  Thought to be a fishing shrine the heiau was built on a prominent bluff overlooking the ocean to the south, what were once the Ninole [[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|fishponds]] to the west and Koloa Bay to the east—home of the legendary na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau (birthing stones) said to have supernatural ability to propagate. These smooth, water-polished stones were highly desired and were used for paving heiau, for arming slingshots and as game pieces for the Hawaiian game konane.  The name Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie is thought to refer to a type of fishing trap or weir made of the fibrous [[Freycinetia arborea|{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie]] vine.  Considered to be in good condition by early surveyors, several walls and a raised stone platform are all that remain of Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie today.  Recent scholarship has interpreted the site as multi-functional.  It likely served as a place of offerings and tributes, an observation point for monitoring the fishponds as well as a communications relay and dissemination location.

The heiau complex of Lanipau was heavily impacted by the construction of the Sea Mountain Resort golf course.  Once the largest of the three, today what remains of Lanipau is in essence an “island” swallowed up by a sea of putting and driving greens.

The heiau complex that sits overlooking the ocean and Punalu{{okina}}u Beach is referred to by many names including Halelau, Kane{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele; Mailekini or Punalu{{okina}}u Nui.  This hieau likely extended to the edge of the cliff at Punalu{{okina}}u Bay.  Its westernmost boundary was destroyed to make way for the construction of a wharf–warehouse complex for the sugar company in 1906.  Identified as a heiau luakini (human sacrifice temple), a large table-like stone rests outside the southernmost wall and is known locally as Pohaku Mohai (sacrificial stone).  Early site surveys noted possible kauhale (houses) adjacent to the heiau that were likely the residences of na [[kahuna]] (religious specialists).

Another important cultural feature is [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail|Ala Kahakai]] (trail by the sea) that served as an important link between ritual centers and coastal communities. The ala kahakai was thought to be the original route taken by the God Lono from North Kohala to the southernmost tip of the island and then windward along the Ka{{okina}}u coast to [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]].  This trail once paved with the na {{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili hanau was designated as a [[National Historic Trail]] in 2000 and remnants can be found at both Punalu{{okina}}u Nui and Ka{{okina}}ie{{okina}}ie heiau.

Ki{{okina}}i pohaku ([[petroglyph]]s) can be found near the County Park Pavilions within a protected area surrounded by a rock wall just past the parking area. It is easy to miss these “unmarked” ancient carvings.

==Endangered species==
[[File:Punaluu turtle.jpg|right|thumb|A ''honu'' resting on Punalu{{okina}}u]]
Rare and endangered native animals known at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole are the honu ea ([[Hawksbill turtle]]), honu ([[Green turtle]]), [[Hawaiian Monk Seal]], native bees, orange-black damselfly, and other [[anchialine pool]] fauna.  Native birds are seen near the shore and cliffs or fly over the area on their way to the sea from upland nesting colonies, including the endangered [[Hawaiian hawk]] ({{okina}}io) that nests in the trees at Punalu{{okina}}u. [[Spinner Dolphin]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s can also be sighted offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u. Residents say such sightings are common.  A rare sighting of a Hawaiian Monk Seal was reported at Punalu{{okina}}u in September 2006 near the boat ramp, and several known nesting sites of the endangered Hawksbill turtles are located along the Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole area. Such occurrences indicate a healthy environment with adequate resources to support large marine animals.

The Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), is a federally listed endangered species and is the rarest sea turtle in the Pacific Ocean.  Researchers estimate there are fewer than 80 nesting Hawksbill turtles in the Hawaiian islands, of which 67 nest on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i.  More than half of the known nesting population statewide, 40 individuals nest along the southeast boundary of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National park to Waikapuna.

The threatened [[Green turtle]] or honu (Chelonia mydas) feeds on marine plants in shallow waters along the coastline such as Punalu{{okina}}u.  Red seaweed, a favorite food of the Green turtle flourishes on the coral-encrusted rocks in the shallow waters of the bay and the turtles are found basking on the black sand beach despite the presence of beachgoers.  Researchers with the National Marine Fisheries have been studying the Green turtle since 1982 along with groups of students. Visitors must remain {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the turtles at all times.

The endangered [[Hawaiian Hoary bat]], {{okina}}ope{{okina}}ape{{okina}}a, (''Lasirus cinereus semotus''), is known to fly over and reside at Punalu{{okina}}u. Their habitat stretches from sea level to over 13,000 feet It usually weighs about 5 to 8 ounces, is nocturnal and feeds on insects.  Relatively little research has been done on this endemic Hawaiian bat and data regarding its habitat and population status is very limited.

One of the largest populations of the rare orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') can be found at Ninole.   It is a candidate endangered species and thrives in the aquatic habitat of the extensive spring complex that stretches from Nīnole Springs to the estuary at Honu{{okina}}apo.  Systematic surveys have observed damselfly populations at Kāwā{{okina}}a, Hīlea, Nīnole, and Honu{{okina}}apo.  The highest densities occur at the back of [[Estuary|estuarine]] [[Salt marsh|marsh]], at the mouth of Hīlea and Nīnole Streams, and at Kāwā{{okina}}a Springs.

==Vegetation==
The native plant communities generally appear as a narrow strand of vegetation, mostly a flattened growth of various shrubs, vines, grass-like plants, scattered trees and herbs. The varied habitats of [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] (smooth, ropy lava), and [[Lava#ʻAʻā|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] flats, drifted sand, anchialine pond shores, protected beaches, and sea spray battered bluffs each support different native plant communities.  In the reconnaissance survey, fourteen species of coastal strand plants (six trees, seven ground cover or shrub forms and the invasive aquatic [[water hyacinth]].  Native plants such as ilima (''[[Sida fallax]]''), naupaka kahakai (''[[Scaevola]] [[Scaevola taccada|taccada]]''), and pōhuehue (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|Ipomoea pes-caprae brasiliensis]]'') were found in the area.

==Wetlands==
[[File:Punalu`u Beach Wetlands.jpg|right|thumb|The wetlands adjacent to Punalu{{okina}}u Beach]]
The second largest [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] complex on Hawai{{okina}}i Island is located at Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  Stretching from Punalu{{okina}}u to Nīnole Springs through Kāwā{{okina}}a to Honu{{okina}}po, is a series of wetlands fed by basal springs and intermittent streams that support a broad range of native fauna.  These spring and pool complexes contain individuals, particularly juveniles or recruits, of several marine invertebrates and fishes, suggesting it may be a significant refuge or nursery area for nearshore marine fauna on the southern coast of Hawaii Island.

==Anchialine pools==
[[Anchialine pool]]s of various types occur near and around Punalu{{okina}}u and Ninole Cove.  These pools are rare and localized [[brackish water]]s along coastal lava flows that exhibit [[Tide|tidal]] fluctuations without a surface connection to the sea.   They include open pools near the shore as well as undisturbed pools in collapsed [[lava tube]]s, cracks, and caves.  Endemic and native shrimp species live in pools and travel between and through them through underground cracks.  The orange-black damselfly (''[[Megalagrion xanthomelas]]'') breeds in the anchialine pools while native insects perch on the nearby vegetation.  Throughout the state, anchialine species are severely threatened by alien insects, habitat loss due to coastal development, and other human impacts.

Anchialine ponds are one of Hawaii’s most threatened ecosystems. Anchialine pools are landlocked brackish ponds located close to the shoreline connected to the ocean via subterranean tunnels. Characterized by tidal fluctuations, these rare and fragile ponds are home to unusual plants and animals.

In the U.S., this habitat exists only in the Hawaiian Islands and, of the approximately 700 known anchialine pools, the majority are located on the island of Hawaii. Formed by volcanic activity, these pools are home to a unique assemblage of invertebrate and algal species, some of which are known to exist only in this habitat. In the last 20 years, alien fish species have been introduced and/or invaded a majority of the pools. These alien species have gradually destroyed the ecological balance in many of the pools by eliminating many of unique endemic species.

==Koa==
Punalu{{okina}}u has long been known for its koa (“fish houses”) where specific species of fish live in specific areas offshore.  The pristine, spring fed waters of Punalu{{okina}}u  mixing with the salt water of the ocean provide ideal habitat for a variety of fish that live in these naturally created koa. There are several koa just offshore from Punalu{{okina}}u still used by local fishermen. Each koa is identified by the species of fish that live there, including [[yellowfin tuna]] (ahi) and [[mackerel]] (ono, or [[wahoo]]). In the old days, Hawaiian families would feed the fish in the koa cooked [[taro]] and pumpkin and the fish, in return, would provide a constant source of protein.

==Development==
A golf course on both sides of the Belt Road was built here by [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]] frm 1969-1972.
A larger resort was proposed in 1986. After opposition, the plans were scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeqc.doh.hawaii.gov/Shared%20Documents/EA_and_EIS_Online_Library/Hawaii/1980s/1988-04-HA-FEIS-PUNALUU-RESORT-VOL-1.pdf |title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Punalu{{okina}}u Resort Volume I |work=state of Hawaii web site |accessdate=2009-10-24 |date=April 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was partially built but abandoned.

This is one of a few other white sand beaches on the west coast of the Big Island. The few others include Kua Bay ([[Manini Beach]]), Mauna Kea Beach and Spencer Park.  If you are visiting the Big Island and thinking of visiting any of these beaches keep in mind they're usually packed, so go bright and early or at about 3 in the afternoon.

The beach has lieguards, but can be hazardous during high surf conditions since the beach is not protected from the open ocean. The park has free admission, paved parking, pavilions, picnic areas, restrooms, and showers.

'''Richardson Beach''' is located just outside of [[Hilo]], [[Hawaii]], on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]].  The name Richardson comes from its original owner and builder of the still-standing home there, Robert Richardson. Richardson was a direct descendant of King [[Kamehameha the Great]], and at one time the [[Chief Detective]] of [[Honolulu]] before retiring to Hilo.

Today the beach is a public park, and the home is occupied and operated as the Richardson Ocean Center.

Richardson Beach is the only beach in Hilo with black sand.

'''Richardson Richardson Beach''' is located just outside of [[Hilo]], [[Hawaii]], on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]].

The name Richardson Richardson comes from its original owner and inventor of the ill-fated dance move. Richardson Richardson was a direct descendant of [[Dude Regals]], and at one time the [[Soule Park Golf Course]]{{dubious}}.

Today the beach is a public park, but his private wedding ceremony will take place at the Richardson Richardson Ocean Center.

Richardson Richardson Beach is the only beach in Hilo with black people, much to his chagrin.

'''Mahana Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sands Beach''') is a natural feature at [[Ka Lae|South Point]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] and one of only two green sand beaches in the [[United States]], the other being in [[Guam]].  The green sand gets its distinctive coloring from [[olivine]] crystals found in a nearby [[cinder cone]].

==Characteristics and formation==

Mahana Beach is located in a [[bay]] circled by [[Pu`u Mahana]], a [[cinder cone]] formed over 49,000 years ago&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Origins of Pu{{okina}}u Mahana are not crystal clear |url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2005/05_10_27.html |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with the southwest rift of [[Mauna Loa]].  

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]].  Commonly found in Hawaiian [[lava]] flows, this mineral is also known as &quot;Hawaiian Diamond&quot; and is found not only in [[periodot]] gems but also in [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu's]] famous [[Diamond Head]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hawaii/page36.html |title=Eruptions of Hawaiian Volcanoes |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the formation of the cinder cone, the active [[waves|tidal action]] of the bay has pounded the shoreline, washing lighter [[black sand|volcanic sand]] and ash out to sea while leaving behind the heavier olivine crystals, giving the beach a distinctive green coloring.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsgreensand&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Sand |url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/greensand.html |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/frequent_questions/grp5/question1428.html |title=How was the green sand beach on the Big Island, Hawaii formed? |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these crystals are eventually washed away as well, the constant erosion of the cinder cone ensures&amp;mdash;eventually, however, the supply will run out and the beach will look like any other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/index.html |title=USGS - Green Sand Beach, Hawai{{okina}}i (Getting There) |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled (a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] cone) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot; /&gt;  Regardless, the geologic history of the site can be seen in the rock surrounding the beach and bay, which are not subject to erosion and thus display geologic layers formed by previous eruptions, lava flows, and other volcanic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/gsand2.html |title=Green Sands Beach - The Beach |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the current patterns of erosion can be seen first-hand, as only the portions at the bottom of the cinder cone collapse have been subject to the waves and turned into green sand; the remaining portions appear gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wrgis.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/gsand3.html |title=Green Sand Beach - Slope |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==

The beach is located at [[Ka Lae|South Point]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].  It is surrounded by pasturelands and is only accessable on foot or by using a vehicle equipped with [[4WD|four-wheel drive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frommers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/hawaiithebigisland/0008020389.html |title=Hawaii (The Big Island): Active Pursuits: Beaches |author=Frommers.com |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To actually reach the beach, an additional climb down the cinder cone is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goworldtravel.com/ex/aspx/articleGuid.%7BAB7491F2-C266-4C4D-8BF2-4B2C69319352%7D/xe/article.htm |title=In Search of Green: The Unusual Side of Hawaii’s Big Island |author=Graber, Janna |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drbeach.org/drbeach/hawaii/beach_hawaiian_bigisland.htm |title=Dr. Beach: Big Island |accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahana Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sands Beach''') is a natural feature at [[Ka Lae|South Point]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] and one of only two green sand beaches in the [[United States]], the other being in [[Guam]].  The green sand gets its distinctive coloring from [[olivine]] crystals found in a nearby [[cinder cone]].

==Characteristics and formation==

[[Image:Green Sands Mahana.jpg|right|thumb|100px|The green sand is more abundant at the bottom of the cinder cone.]]
Mahana Beach is located in a [[bay]] circled by [[Pu`u Mahana]], a [[cinder cone]] formed over 49,000 years ago&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with the southwest rift of [[Mauna Loa]].  

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]].  Commonly found in Hawaiian [[lava]] flows, this mineral is also known as &quot;Hawaiian Diamond&quot; and is found not only in [[peridot]] gems but also in [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu's]] famous [[Diamond Head]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled (a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] cone) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt;  Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2005, the [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini project]] observed the collision of [[Deep Impact (space mission)|Deep Impact]] with the [[comet]] [[9P/Tempel]].  By examining the aftermath of the collision in infrared, scientists were able to confirm that a portion of the material ejected was olivine crystals similar in shape and structure to the sand found at Mahana Beach, albeit smaller.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_gemini&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled (a [[Littoral zone|littoral]] cone) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt;  Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Mahana Beach''' (also known as ''Green Sands Beach'' and, erroneously, ''Pu{{okina}}u Mahana'') is a [[greensand|green sand]] beach located at [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality.

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Mahana Beach''' (also known as ''Green Sands Beach'' and, erroneously, ''Pu{{okina}}u Mahana'') is a [[greensand|green sand]] beach located at [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2005, the [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini project]] observed the collision of [[Deep Impact (space mission)|Deep Impact]] with the [[comet]] [[9P/Tempel]].

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality. Olivine is a common mineral component of Hawaiian [[lava]]s and one of the first crystals to form as [[magma]] cools.&lt;ref name=&quot;westhawaiisand&quot; /&gt; Olivine is locally known as &quot;Hawaiian Diamond&quot; and is notably found in [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu's]] famous [[Diamond Head]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakolea Beach''' (also known as ''Green Sand Beach'', ''Mahana Beach'' and, erroneously, ''Pu{{okina}}u Mahana'') is a green sand beach located at [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality. Olivine is a common mineral component of Hawaiian [[lava]]s and one of the first crystals to form as [[magma]] cools.&lt;ref name=&quot;westhawaiisand&quot; /&gt; Olivine is locally known as &quot;Hawaiian Diamond&quot; and is notably found in [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu's]] famous [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Olivine, being denser and tougher than the ash fragments, glass and black [[pyroxene]] of the rest of the rocks and lava flows, tends to accumulate on the beach whereas the usual [[black sand|volcanic sand]] is swept out to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsgreensand&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2005, the [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini project]] observed the collision of [[Deep Impact (space mission)|Deep Impact]] with the [[comet]] [[9P/Tempel]]. By examining the aftermath of the collision in infrared, scientists were able to confirm that a portion of the material ejected was olivine crystals similar in shape and structure to the sand found at Papakolea Beach, albeit smaller.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_gemini&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakolea Beach''' (also known as ''Green Sand Beach'', ''Mahana Beach'' and, erroneously, ''Pu{{okina}}u Mahana'') is a green sand beach located at [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with the southwest rift of [[Mauna Loa]]. Since its last eruption, the cinder cone has partially collapsed and been partially eroded by the ocean.

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality. Olivine is a common mineral component of Hawaiian [[lava]]s and one of the first crystals to form as [[magma]] cools.&lt;ref name=&quot;westhawaiisand&quot; /&gt; Olivine is locally known as &quot;Hawaiian Diamond&quot; and is notably found in [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu's]] famous [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the green coloration of the beach sands is due to the olivine crystals which are winnowed from the eroding headland by the action of the sea. Olivine, being denser and tougher than the ash fragments, glass and black [[pyroxene]] of the rest of the rocks and lava flows, tends to accumulate on the beach whereas the usual [[black sand|volcanic sand]] is swept out to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsgreensand&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these crystals are eventually washed away as well, the constant erosion of the cinder cone ensures a steady supply of sand for the foreseeable future&amp;mdash;eventually, however, the supply will run out and the beach will look like any other.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettingthere&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the geologic history of the site can be seen in the rock surrounding the beach and bay, which are not subject to erosion and thus display geologic layers formed by previous eruptions, lava flows, and other volcanic events.&lt;ref name=&quot;thebeach&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the current patterns of erosion can be seen first-hand, as only the portions at the bottom of the cinder cone collapse have been subject to the waves and turned into green sand; the remaining portions appear gray.&lt;ref name=&quot;slope&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2005, the [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini project]] observed the collision of [[Deep Impact (space mission)|Deep Impact]] with the [[comet]] [[9P/Tempel]]. By examining the aftermath of the collision in infrared, scientists were able to confirm that a portion of the material ejected was olivine crystals similar in shape and structure to the sand found at Papakolea Beach, albeit smaller.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_gemini&quot;&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakōlea Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sand Beach''' or '''Mahana Beach'''&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1905507|Mahana Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a green sand beach located near [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

The beach is sometimes named after the cinder cone, and sometimes after the area of land called Papakōlea, which comes from ''papa kōlea'', which means [[plover]] flats in the [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=Papakolea |title=lookup of Papakolea |work= on Place Names of Hawai'i |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2004 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papakōlea is the area near the crater&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|363129|Papakōlea}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Pacific Golden Plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') are sometimes seen in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=plover |title=lookup of plover |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality.

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}u region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakōlea Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sand Beach''' or '''Mahana Beach'''&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1905507|Mahana Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a green sand beach located near [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with the southwest rift of [[Mauna Loa]]. Since its last eruption, the cinder cone has partially collapsed and been partially eroded by the ocean. The beach is sometimes named after the cinder cone, and sometimes after the area of land called Papakōlea, which comes from ''papa kōlea'', which means [[plover]] flats in the [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=Papakolea |title=lookup of Papakolea |work= on Place Names of Hawai'i |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2004 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papakōlea is the area near the crater&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|363129|Papakōlea}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Pacific Golden Plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') are sometimes seen in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=plover |title=lookup of plover |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality. Olivine is a common mineral component of Hawaiian [[lava]]s and one of the first crystals to form as [[magma]] cools.&lt;ref name=&quot;westhawaiisand&quot; /&gt; Olivine is locally known as &quot;Hawaiian Diamond&quot; and is notably found in [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu's]] famous [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the green coloration of the beach sands is due to the olivine crystals which are winnowed from the eroding headland by the action of the sea.

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}ū region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakōlea Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sand Beach''' or '''Mahana Beach'''&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1905507|Mahana Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a green sand beach located near [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

The beach is sometimes named after the cinder cone, and sometimes after the area of land called Papakōlea, which comes from ''papa kōlea'', which means [[plover]] flats in the [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=Papakolea |title=lookup of Papakolea |work= on Place Names of Hawai'i |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2004 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papakōlea is the area near the crater&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|363129|Papakōlea}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Pacific Golden Plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') are sometimes seen in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=plover |title=lookup of plover |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality.

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}ū region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}ū region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakōlea Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sand Beach''' or '''Mahana Beach'''&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1905507|Mahana Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a green sand beach located near [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]].

'''Papakōlea Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sand Beach''' or '''Mahana Beach'''&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1905507|Mahana Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a green sand beach located near [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. One of only two green sand beaches in the World, the other being in Galapagos Islands. It gets its distinctive coloring from the mineral [[olivine]], found in the enclosing [[cinder cone]]. Olivine is a mineral which is composed of the semi-precious stone peridot.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with the southwest rift of [[Mauna Loa]]. Since its last eruption, the cinder cone has partially collapsed and been partially eroded by the ocean. The beach is sometimes named after the cinder cone, and sometimes after the area of land called Papakōlea, which comes from ''papa kōlea'', which means [[plover]] flats in the [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=Papakolea |title=lookup of Papakolea |work= on Place Names of Hawai'i |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2004 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papakōlea is the area near the crater&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|363129|Papakōlea}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Pacific Golden Plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') are sometimes seen in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=plover |title=lookup of plover |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality.

Olivine, being denser and tougher than the ash fragments, glass and black [[pyroxene]] of the rest of the rocks and lava flows, tends to accumulate on the beach whereas the usual [[black sand|volcanic sand]] is swept out to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsgreensand&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a [[cinder cone|littoral cone]]) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}ū region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Papakōlea Beach''' (also known as '''Green Sand Beach''' or '''Mahana Beach'''&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|1905507|Mahana Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a green sand beach located near [[Ka Lae|South Point]], in the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. One of only two green sand beaches in the World, the other being in Galapagos Islands. It gets its distinctive coloring from the mineral [[olivine]], found in the enclosing [[cinder cone]]. Olivine is a mineral which is composed of the semi-precious stone peridot.

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality.

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a littoral cone) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}ū region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The beach is sometimes named after the cinder cone, and sometimes after the area of land called Papakōlea, which comes from ''papa kōlea'', which means [[plover]] flats in the [[Hawaiian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?a=q&amp;j=pp&amp;l=en&amp;q=Papakolea |title=lookup of Papakolea |work= on Place Names of Hawai'i |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2004 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papakōlea is the area near the crater&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|363129|Papakōlea}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Pacific Golden Plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') are sometimes seen in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=plover |title=lookup of plover |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year=2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= 2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinder cone is rich in [[olivine]], a [[silicate]] mineral containing [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], also known as [[peridot]] when of gem quality. Olivine is a common mineral component of Hawaiian [[lava]]s and one of the first crystals to form as [[magma]] cools.&lt;ref name=&quot;westhawaiisand&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the green coloration of the beach sands is due to the olivine crystals which are winnowed from the eroding headland by the action of the sea. Olivine, being denser and tougher than the ash fragments, glass and black [[pyroxene]] of the rest of the rocks and lava flows, tends to accumulate on the beach whereas the usual [[black sand|volcanic sand]] is swept out to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsgreensand&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these crystals are eventually washed away as well, the constant erosion of the cinder cone ensures a steady supply of sand for the foreseeable future&amp;mdash;eventually, however, the supply will run out and the beach will look like any other.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettingthere&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/index.html |title=Green Sand Beach - Getting There |work=[http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/ Coastal Geology of the Parks] |location=Reston, VA &amp; Denver, CO, USA | publisher = [[USGS]] |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the cinder cone is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a littoral cone) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation to make such an event possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgsorigins&quot;/&gt; Regardless of how it was formed according to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Ka{{okina}}ū region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">'''Kamilo Beach''' is situated at the southernmost tip of the [[Big Island]], of [[Hawaii]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

It is best known for its accumulation of debris from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

=History=
This once pristine beach used to be a location where native Hawaiians would to come to find large logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=Location=
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 miles long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]]. 

=Description=
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is the dirtiest beach in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and possibly the dirtiest beach in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt; The crescent shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging currents.

=Debris=
The accumulated garbage on Kamilo Beach consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Various household objects comprise the bulk of the trash including: toothbrushes, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic caps and bottles, cups, keyboards, DVDs, plates, combs, knives, forks, babies' dummies, toys, TVs, sandwich wrappers, lipsticks, hair brushes, pens, shoes, plugs, and clocks.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494758/How-womans-battle-save-dying-albatross-spawned-national-campaign-ban-plastic-bags.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

=Cleanup efforts=
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign]], Hawaii, joined [[University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo|University of Hawaii, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;
http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent effort was organized by Bill Gilmartin, a retired [[wildlife biologist]].

It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=Location=
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 miles long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]]. 

=Description=
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is the dirtiest beach in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and possibly the dirtiest beach in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt; The crescent shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging currents.

=Debris=
The accumulated garbage on Kamilo Beach consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Various household objects comprise the bulk of the trash including: toothbrushes, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic caps and bottles, cups, keyboards, DVDs, plates, combs, knives, forks, babies' dummies, toys, TVs, sandwich wrappers, lipsticks, hair brushes, pens, shoes, plugs, and clocks.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494758/How-womans-battle-save-dying-albatross-spawned-national-campaign-ban-plastic-bags.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

=Cleanup efforts=
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign]], Hawaii, joined [[University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo|University of Hawaii, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;
http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 12, 2008 B.E.A.C.H. organized a volunteer cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iyor-hawaii.org/?m=200804&amp;cat=3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamilo Beach''' is situated at the southernmost tip of the [[Big Island]], of [[Hawaii]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

It is best known for its accumulation of debris from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

=History=
This once pristine beach used to be a location where native Hawaiians would to come to find large logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=Location=
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 miles long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]]. 

=Description=
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt;

The crescent shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging currents.

=Debris=
The accumulated garbage on Kamilo Beach consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Various household objects comprise the bulk of the trash including: toothbrushes, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic caps and bottles, cups, keyboards, DVDs, plates, combs, knives, forks, babies' dummies, toys, TVs, sandwich wrappers, lipsticks, hair brushes, pens, shoes, plugs, and clocks.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494758/How-womans-battle-save-dying-albatross-spawned-national-campaign-ban-plastic-bags.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

This once pristine beach used to be a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would to come to find large logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=Location=
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 miles long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]]. 

=Description=
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

=Debris=
The accumulated garbage on Kamilo Beach consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Various household objects comprise the bulk of the trash including: toothbrushes, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic caps and bottles, cups, keyboards, DVDs, plates, combs, knives, forks, babies' dummies, toys, TVs, sandwich wrappers, lipsticks, hair brushes, pens, shoes, plugs, and clocks.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494758/How-womans-battle-save-dying-albatross-spawned-national-campaign-ban-plastic-bags.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the [[Hawaii Wildlife Fund]] organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign]], Hawaii, joined [[University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo|University of Hawaii, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=Environmental impact=
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered substantial damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing line traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. The [[albatross]] population has suffered from ingesting large items, notably young birds fed by their parents.

Some types of plastic such as  [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others, absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed by wildlife, these toxins are then abosorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamilo Beach''' is situated at the southernmost tip of the [[Big Island]], of [[Hawaii]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

It is best known for its accumulation of [[debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

==History==
This once pristine beach used to be a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would to come to find large evergreen logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 miles long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]]. 

==Description==
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage on Kamilo Beach consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Various household objects comprise the bulk of the trash including: toothbrushes, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic caps and bottles, cups, keyboards, DVDs, plates, combs, knives, forks, babies' dummies, toys, TVs, sandwich wrappers, lipsticks, hair brushes, pens, shoes, plugs, and clocks.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-494758/How-womans-battle-save-dying-albatross-spawned-national-campaign-ban-plastic-bags.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|360px|right|This Laysan Albatross chick has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered substantial damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing line traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. The [[albatross]] population has suffered from ingesting large items, notably young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] mistake plastic bags for [[jelly fish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as  [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed, these toxins are then absorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the [[Hawaii Wildlife Fund]] organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign]], Hawaii, joined [[University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo|University of Hawaii, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent cleanup occurred on April 12, 2008, organized by B-E-A-C-H (Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii) volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iyor-hawaii.org/?m=200804&amp;cat=3&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign]], Hawaii, joined [[University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo|University of Hawaii, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent cleanup occurred on April 12, 2008, organized by B-E-A-C-H (Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii) volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iyor-hawaii.org/?m=200804&amp;cat=3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|230px|right|Kamilo Beach, Hawaii]]
'''Kamilo Beach''' is situated at the southernmost tip of the [[Big Island]], of [[Hawaii]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

It is best known for its accumulation of [[debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

==History==
This once pristine beach used to be a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would to come to find large evergreen logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 miles long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]]. 

==Description==
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage on Kamilo Beach consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing line traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] mistake plastic bags for [[jelly fish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed, these toxins are then absorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean up on November, 2007 removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from the beach.

The beach has never been fully cleared of debris. The amount of garbage on the beach makes access difficult.

[[Sea turtles]] mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed, these toxins are then absorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the [[Hawaii Wildlife Fund]] organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai'i]], joined [[University_of_Hawaii_at_Hilo|University of Hawaii, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean up on November, 2007 removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from the beach.

The beach has never been fully cleared of debris because the actual amount of garbage itself makes access difficult.

[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|230px|right|Kamilo Beach, Hawaii]]
'''Kamilo Beach''' is situated at the southernmost tip of the [[Big Island]], of [[Hawaii]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

It is best known for its accumulation of [[debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

==History==
This once pristine beach used to be a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would to come to find large evergreen logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Kamilo Beach is approximately 5 meters long, and is located in remote area of [[Ka'u]], at the south tip of the [[Big Island]].

==Description==
Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage which covers Kamilo Beach, and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shorline, consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents.

Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage which covers Kamilo Beach, and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shorline, consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing lines, traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed, these toxins are then absorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2006/Sea-Plague-Plastic2aug06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the [[Hawai'i Wildlife Fund]] organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Charles Moore, head of the [[Algalita Research Foundation]] in [[Long Beach], California]], and volunteers from the [[Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai'i]], joined [[University_of_Hawai'i_at_Hilo|University of Hawai'i, Hilo]] students in an effort to cleanup Kamilo Beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/11/11/news/story02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean up on November, 2007 removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from the beach.

The beach has never been fully cleared of debris because the actual amount of garbage itself makes access difficult.

A clean up on November, 2007 removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from the beach.

The beach has never been fully cleared of debris because the actual amount of garbage itself makes access difficult.

[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing lines, traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents.

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings.

In February 2006, the [[Hawaii Wildlife Fund|Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund]] organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A clean up on November, 2007 removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from the beach.

The beach has never been fully cleared of debris because the actual amount of garbage itself makes access difficult.

[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing lines, traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents.

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings.

A clean up on November, 2007 removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from the beach.

The beach has never been fully cleared of debris because the actual amount of garbage itself makes access difficult.

Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage which covers Kamilo Beach, and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shoreline, consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing lines, traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents.

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings.

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo beach have included those by Hawai`i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai`i.  In February 2006, the Hawaiʻi Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai`i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

'''Kamilo Beach''' is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].  It is known for its accumulation of [[marine debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/July-2008/Getting-Trashed/ Getting Trashed - Honolulu Magazine - July 2008 - Hawaii&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This once pristine beach used to be a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would to come to find large evergreen logs for [[dug-out]] canoes which drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was also a location where people who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2 Plague of Plastic Chokes the Seas - Los Angeles Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Kamilo Beach is approximately 450 meters long, and is located in the southernmost [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]], on the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii.

==Description==
Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches on the Hawaiian islands that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade winds]] and converging [[currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage which covers Kamilo Beach, and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shoreline, consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing lines, traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2 ABC News: Landfill in the Sea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed, these toxins are then absorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/ Sea of plastic :: Honolulu Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo beach have included those by Hawai`i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai`i.  In February 2006, the Hawaiʻi Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai`i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

==Location==
Kamilo Beach is approximately 450 meters long, and is located in the southernmost [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]], on the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii.

==Description==
Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches on the Hawaiian islands that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', in terms of debris, Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach on the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]] shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage which covers Kamilo Beach, and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shoreline, consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as 'plastic sand', and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird has been fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on Kamilo beach and floating off shore.

Fishing debris such as discarded [[Fishing net|nets]] and fishing lines, traps, strangles, or drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, notably young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2 ABC News: Landfill in the Sea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. When consumed, these toxins are then absorbed by the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/ Sea of plastic :: Honolulu Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place in recent years. Prior to that, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo beach have included those by Hawai`i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai`i.  In February 2006, the Hawaiʻi Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers, who removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamilo Beach''' (literally, ''the twisting'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].  It is known for its accumulation of [[marine debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/July-2008/Getting-Trashed/ Getting Trashed - Honolulu Magazine - July 2008 - Hawaii&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient times, Kamilo Beach was a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would go to find large evergreen logs, drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]], for building [[dug-out]] canoes. It was also a location where those who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?S=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/oceans/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,3130914.story?page=2 Plague of Plastic Chokes the Seas - Los Angeles Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately 450 meters long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach in the Hawaiian Islands in terms of amount of debris, and is considered one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on- and off-shore. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s, fishing lines, traps, and strangles, drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds may die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2 ABC News: Landfill in the Sea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]], [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/ Sea of plastic :: Honolulu Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on- and off-shore. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s, fishing lines, traps, and strangles, drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds may die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents.

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]], [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down.

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately 450 meters long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach in the Hawaiian Islands in terms of amount of debris, and is considered one of the dirtiest beaches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

'''Kamilo Beach''' (literally, ''the twisting'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].  It is known for its accumulation of [[marine debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
In ancient times, Kamilo Beach was a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would go to find large evergreen logs, drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]], for building [[dug-out]] canoes.

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}}}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach in the Hawaiian Islands in terms of amount of debris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 4.5 kilometers of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on- and off-shore. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s, fishing lines, traps, and strangles, drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds may die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2 ABC News: Landfill in the Sea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]], [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/ Sea of plastic :: Honolulu Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. Also known as ''Plastic Beach'', Kamilo Beach is by far the dirtiest beach in the Hawaiian Islands in terms of amount of debris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=598914 Seas of Shame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on- and off-shore. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s, fishing lines, traps, and strangles, drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds may die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2 ABC News: Landfill in the Sea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]], [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/ Sea of plastic :: Honolulu Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was 8 to 10 feet high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons (9 tonnes) of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

'''Kamilo Beach''' (literally, ''the twisting'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].  It is known for its accumulation of plastic [[marine debris]] from the [[Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In ancient times, Kamilo Beach was a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would go to find large evergreen logs, drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]], for building [[dug-out]] canoes.

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khnl.com/Global/story.asp?s=7334574 KHNL NBC 8 Honolulu Hawaii |Big Island Beach Attracts Plastic Trash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on- and off-shore. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s, fishing lines, traps, and strangles, drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds may die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/Story?id=4528488&amp;page=2 ABC News: Landfill in the Sea&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]], [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honoluluweekly.com/diary/2007/12/sea-of-plastic/ Sea of plastic :: Honolulu Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons (9 tonnes) of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/charleswilliam3/beach_cleanup&amp;gcmd=add_comment Hawaii Wildlife Fund - South Point Beach Cleanup 2/06 Photo Gallery by CW Lawrence at pbase.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the garbage on- and off-shore. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s, fishing lines, traps, and strangles, drowns birds and [[sea mammals]]. Birds may die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref name=Rooney&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of plastic such as [[bisphenol A]], [[DEHP]], [[phthalates]], and [[styrene]], leech [[carcinogenic]] or poisonous [[chemicals]] when they break down. Others absorb [[toxins]] such as [[DDT]] and [[PCB]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref name=McNarie&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-12-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons (9 tonnes) of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref name=PBase&gt;{{cite web

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are fishing related such as nets, rope, eel cones, oyster spacers, buoys, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either [[pre-production]] or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Natural World, Message in the Waves - Hawai'i&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref name=Rooney&gt;{{cite news

'''Kamilo Beach''' (literally, ''the twisting'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]], used for sculptures, was gathered by local artists.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref name=Rooney&gt;{{cite news

'''Kamilo Beach''' (literally, ''the twisting'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]] was gathered by local artists for use in sculptures.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii.]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}u District]] on the island of Hawaii.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking.]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref name=Rooney&gt;{{cite news

In ancient times, Kamilo Beach was a location where [[Native Hawaiians]] would go to find large [[Pinales|evergreen]] logs, drifted ashore from the [[Pacific Northwest]], for building [[Dugout (boat)#Pacific Islands|dugout canoes]].

Around 1960, Kamilo Beach was still free of man-made debris, with the exception of a few tires. It was then a place where [[driftwood]] was gathered by local artists for use in sculptures.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s. Birds die from ingesting large pieces of plastic, especially young birds fed by their parents. [[Sea turtles]] may mistake plastic bags for [[jellyfish]] and choke.&lt;ref name=Rooney&gt;{{cite news

At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons (9 tonnes) of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref name=PBase&gt;{{cite web

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

Kamilo Beach is one of many beaches in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] that receives large amounts of debris from the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

The [[crescent]]-shaped beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s.
Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as [[bisphenol A]], [[bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]], and [[polystyrene]], [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leach leach] [[carcinogen]]ic or poisonous [[chemical]]s when they [[Biodegradation|break down]]. Others absorb [[toxin]]s such as [[DDT]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref name=McNarie&gt;{{cite news

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John R. K. (1985), ''Beaches of the Big Island'', University of Hawaii Press, ISBN-13: 9780824809768, ISBN-10: 0824809769, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.

The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John R. K. (1985), ''Beaches of the Big Island'', University of Hawaii Press, ISBN-13: 9780824809768, ISBN-10: 0824809769, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as naupaka, milo, and ironweed.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John R. K. (1985), ''Beaches of the Big Island'', University of Hawaii Press, ISBN-13: 9780824809768, ISBN-10: 0824809769, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.

The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

The beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as naupaka, milo, and ironweed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s.
Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as [[bisphenol A]], [[bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]], and [[polystyrene]], [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leach leach] [[carcinogen]]ic or poisonous [[chemical]]s when they [[Biodegradation|break down]]. Others absorb [[toxin]]s such as [[DDT]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref name=McNarie&gt;{{cite news

At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years.

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.

The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

The beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[Trade wind|trade winds]] and converging [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as naupaka, milo, and ironweed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand.&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[Image: Albatross_chick_plastic.jpg|thumb|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s.
Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as [[bisphenol A]], [[bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]], and [[polystyrene]], [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leach leach] [[carcinogen]]ic or poisonous [[chemical]]s when they [[Biodegradation|break down]]. Others absorb [[toxin]]s such as [[DDT]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref name=McNarie&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons (9 tonnes) of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref name=PBase&gt;{{cite web

==Description==
[[Image:HIMap-doton-Naalehu.PNG|thumb|Location of Kamilo Beach on the island of Hawaii]]
Kamilo Beach is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū District]] on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates {{coord |18|58|13|N|155|35|59|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI| display=inline,title}}. There are no paved roads to the beach.

This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.

The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

The beach is an accumulation zone for [[plastic]] trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant [[trade wind]]s and converging [[ocean current]]s.

The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as naupaka, milo, and ironweed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-1985-69&quot; /&gt;

==Debris==
The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5&amp;nbsp;km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079st6 |network=[[BBC Two]] |title=Natural World |episode=Message in the Waves - Hawai'i}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority are [[fishing]] related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap [[hagfish]], spacers used in [[oyster farming]], [[buoy]]s, crates, and baskets.

Part of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production [[nurdle]]s or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are referred to as &quot;plastic sand&quot;&lt;ref name=Dashefsky/&gt;, and now exceed the volume of the beach's natural sand{{Dubious|date=February 2012}}.

==Environmental impact==
[[Image:Albatross chick plastic.jpg|thumb|A young bird that was fed plastic by its parents and was unable to eject it, resulting in its death by either starvation or choking]]
[[Wildlife]] in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded [[fishing net]]s and [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Drowning|drowns]], [[Strangling|strangles]], and traps birds and [[marine mammal]]s.
Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as [[bisphenol A]], [[bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]], and [[polystyrene]], [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leach leach] [[carcinogen]]ic or poisonous [[chemical]]s when they [[Biodegradation|break down]]. Others absorb [[toxin]]s such as [[DDT]] and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.&lt;ref name=McNarie&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup efforts==
At least three major cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to the efforts, the debris was {{convert|8|to|10|ft|m}} high in some places.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;  Efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have included those by the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawai{{okina}}i.  In February 2006, the Hawai{{okina}}i Wildlife Fund organized 120 volunteers and removed 400 garbage bags of debris and up to 10 tons (9 tonnes) of fishing nets from the beach.&lt;ref name=PBase&gt;{{cite web

'''Isaac Hale Beach Park''', also known as '''Pohoiki''' is an oceanfront park, boat launch and surf location along '''Pohoiki Bay''' in the [[Puna district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawaii]]. It is only one of a few places in the Southeast shore of Hawaii that allows for such facilities. Pohoiki Bay is known for its strong currents and although the park in known for good snorkeling, conditions are usually not ideal. The park was recently expanded and modernized in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaii-county.com/parks/isaachale.htm County of Hawaii Parks and Recreation&lt;/ref&gt;

A 217 acre marine preserve was created off shore in 1992.
A day use boat mooring is near the prominent &quot;Shark Rock&quot; toward the northwestern boundary. Water depth at the mooring is about 40 feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/dar/coral/mlcd_old_kona.html Old Kona Airport] at the Marine Life Conservation District official web site&lt;/ref&gt;
A reef shelf East of Shark rock creates a small surf break.
[[Snorkeling|Snorkle]]rs and [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]] usually enter the water at a protected cove at the Northwestern end of the beach.
On '''Kuka{{okina}}ilimoku Point''' Southeast of the park sits a lighthouse to guide ships into Kailua Bay.
North of the park is '''Papawai Bay''' (meaning &quot;water layer&quot; in the [[Hawaiian Language]]).&lt;ref&gt;John R. K. Clark, ''Hawai'i place names: shores, beaches, and surf sites'', Published by University of Hawaii Press, 2001, ISBN 978-0824824518&lt;/ref&gt;

The old 3800 foot long runway is used for a large parking lot and the old terminal building is now a public use pavilion. There is a flat walking trail parallel to the runway, restrooms, showers, and picnic facilities. There are some patches of sand, but the shore is rocky, so care should be taken when entering the water except in calm conditions. No lifeguards are on duty.

==Hilton Waikoloa Village==
The Hilton Waikoloa Village is built on 62 acres and has 1240 rooms and suites with tropical gardens, waterfalls, lagoons and waterways, awaiting your arrival by the hotel’s exclusive tram or boat. The Hilton Waikoloa Village recently unveiled the new Dolphin Quest Village.

It can be confused for [[Waikoloa Village]], a CDP in the same &quot;[[ahupuaʻa]]&quot; and is also known as &quot;Waikoloa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waikoloabeachresort.com/Waikoloa-Beach-Resort Official Web site for the Waikoloa Beach Resort]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The area is home to many notable cultural and geologic features of the ancient [[Hawaiian culture]] including [[aquaculture]] fishponds, [[anchialine]] ponds and [[petroglyphs]].    

==Ala Kahakai==
Ala Kahakai or “trail by the sea” is the name for the ancient pathway that runs along the coastline in the Waikoloa area that linked important entities in the Hawaiian culture including communities, temples, fishing areas, etc. The Wikoloa Ala Kahakai, estimated to be {{convert|175|mi|km}} long, is commonly called “King’s Trail&quot;.

==Anaehoomalu Bay==

==Anchialine Ponds==
The anchialine ponds of Waikoloa were part of Hawaiian culture and were preserved in 1985 as the '''Waikoloa Anchialine Pond Preservation Area''' maintained by the [[University of Hawaii]]. The [[brackish water]] lava pools located just at the coastline are fed by both freshwater springs from rain water and sea water making the ponds a unique [[microclimate]] suitable for a various small fishes, [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusk]]s and tiny red [[shrimp]].

==Ku{{okina}}uali{{okina}}i and Kahapapa Fishponds==
The Ku{{okina}}uali{{okina}}i and Kahapapa Fishponds are located just behind the Waikoloa Beach in Anaeho{{okina}}omalu bay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">'''Kauna{{okina}}oa Bay''' has one of the few white sand beaches of the [[Kohala Coast]], the western side of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. A historic hotel is located on the bay, which has given it the name '''Mauna Kea Beach'''.

==Description==

==History==
The land above the bay is part of the [[Parker Ranch]]. In 1960 the area was a remote, barren, hot lava field unsuitable for cattle grazing. [[William F. Quinn]], the governor of the new state of [[Hawaii]], invited [[Laurance Rockefeller]] to visit the islands as part of a study for a federal commission that Rockefeller chaired. After visiting the ranch, Rockefeller was taken for a swim in the bay. Plans for a resort began in January 1961. The state agreed to pave the [[Hawaii Belt Road]] (called the Queen [[Kaahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] highway) to the site and build a new [[Kona International Airport]].  Rockefeller bought the land of the nearby [[Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site|Pu{{okina}}ukoholā Heiau]] and donated it for a National Historic Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;paradise&quot;/&gt;

The open-air design allowed natural ventilation from the [[trade winds]], although rooms had air conditioning available. The hotel finally opened in July 1965, one of the most expensive at the time. Hotels with similar designs would be built along the Kohala coast over the next decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;paradise&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Don Hibbard|author2=Augie Salbosa|title=Designing paradise: the allure of the Hawaiian resort |chapter= Where God Left Off: The Diamond Tiara of Laurance Rockerfeller and a Polynesian Village |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=REJB-dhBLQsC&amp;pg=PA101 |year=2006 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=9781568985749 |pages=101–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The land above the bay is part of the [[Parker Ranch]]. In 1960 the area was a remote, barren, hot lava field unsuitable for cattle grazing. [[William F. Quinn]], the governor of the new state of [[Hawaii]], invited [[Laurance Rockefeller]] to visit the islands as part of a study for a federal commission that Rockefeller chaired. After visiting the ranch, Rockefeller was taken for a swim in the bay. Plans for a resort began in January 1961. The state agreed to pave the [[Hawaii Belt Road]] (called the Queen [[Kaahumanu|Ka{{okina}}ahumanu]] highway for this section) to the site and build a new [[Kona International Airport]].  Rockefeller bought the land of the nearby [[Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site|Pu{{okina}}ukoholā Heiau]] and donated it for a National Historic Park. Original plans were to use architect [[John Carl Warnecke]] and build a series of small cottages, but those plans were abandoned. Instead firm [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] was hired to use a modern style.&lt;ref name=&quot;paradise&quot;/&gt;

The open-air design allowed natural ventilation from the [[trade winds]], although rooms had air conditioning available. The hotel finally opened in July 1965, one of the most expensive at the time. Hotels with similar designs would be built along the Kohala coast over the next decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;paradise&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Don Hibbard|author2=Augie Salbosa|title=Designing paradise: the allure of the Hawaiian resort |chapter= Where God Left Off: The Diamond Tiara of Laurance Rockefeller and a Polynesian Village |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=REJB-dhBLQsC&amp;pg=PA101 |year=2006 |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |isbn=9781568985749 |pages=101–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
