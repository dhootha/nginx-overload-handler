[[Image:Kriek Beer.jpg|thumb|right|260px|A glass of Belgian kriek beer]]
'''Kriek lambic''', or '''kriek''' (pronounced 'creek') in short, is a style of [[Belgian beer]], made by fermenting [[lambic]] with [[sour cherry|sour Morello cherries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Traditionally &quot;[[Schaerbeek|Schaarbeekse]] krieken&quot; (a rare Belgian [[Morello Cherry|Morello]] variety) from the area around [[Brussels]] are used. As the Schaarbeek type cherries have become more difficult to find, some brewers have replaced these (partly or completely) with other varieties of sour cherries, sometimes imported.

Traditionally, kriek is made by breweries in and around Brussels using lambic beer to which sour cherries (with the pits) are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The cherries are left in for a period of several months, causing a refermentation of the additional sugar. Typically no sugar will be left so there will be a fruit flavour without sweetness. There will be a further maturation process after the cherries are removed.

More recently, some lambic brewers have added sugar to the final product of their fruit beers, in order to make them less intense and more approachable to a wider audience. They also use cherry juice rather than whole cherries and are matured for much shorter periods.

[[Framboise]] or [[Framboise|Frambozenbier]] is a related, less traditional [[Belgian beer]], fermented with raspberries instead of sour cherries. Kriek is also related to [[geuze]], which is not a fruit beer but is also based on refermented lambic beer. Some breweries, like [[Liefmans Breweries|Liefmans]], make cherry beers based on [[oud bruin]] beer instead of lambic.

'''Rye beer''' refers to any [[beer]] in which [[rye]] (generally [[malt]]ed) is substituted for some portion of the [[barley]] malt. 

One example of this is [[roggenbier]] which is a specialty beer produced with up to sixty percent rye malt. The style originated in [[Bavaria]], in southern [[Germany]] and is brewed with the same type of [[yeast]] as a German [[hefeweizen]] resulting in a similar light, dry, spicy taste.

In the [[United States]] another style of rye beer is being developed by [[homebrewing|homebrewers]] and [[microbreweries]]. In some examples, the [[Hops|hop]] presence is pushed to the point where they resemble American [[India pale ale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/458/2255&lt;/ref&gt;  This style is often called a &quot;Rye-P-A,&quot; a take-off of the abbreviation for an India Pale Ale, &quot;IPA.&quot;

Finnish [[sahti]] is another style of rye beer, produced by brewing rye with juniper berries and wild yeast.

Another type of rye beer is [[kvass]], although the alcohol is low enough to be considered an [[Non-alcoholic beer|NA]] in many cases.

In theory, a [[Rauchbier|rauchroggen]] could be made by drying some rye malt over an open flame rather than in a kiln, although there are currently no commercial examples.

==Roggenbier==
Until the 15th Century, it was common in [[Germany]], particularly in [[Bavaria]], to use [[rye]] [[malt]] for brewing beer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  However, after a period of bad harvests, it was ruled that rye would only be used for baking [[bread]], (thus only [[barley]] was to be used for beer, see the German law known as the [[Reinheitsgebot]]). Roggenbier virtually disappeared for almost five hundred years. In 1988, it reappeared in Bavaria.

The modern version of roggenbier is typically about 5% ABV and is fairly dark in colour. The flavour is grainy, often having a hearty flavour similar to [[pumpernickel]] bread. Typically, at least 50 percent of the malts used to make the beer are made from rye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Deutsche Brauer-Bund | url = http://www.brauer-bund.de/bierfans/sorten/spezi.htm#roggenbier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4116">[[File:Founders_Curmudgeon_(Old_Ale).jpg|thumb|right|Founders Curmudgeon old ale]]
'''Old ale''' is a term commonly applied to dark, malty beers in England, generally above 5% [[abv]], also to dark ales of any strength in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/old_ale.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Beer Styles: Old (Ale) |publisher=Beerhunter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes associated with ''stock ale'' or, archaically, ''keeping ale'', in which the beer is held at the brewery. 

Historically, old ales served as a complement to [[mild ale]]s, and in pubs of the era typically the landlord would serve the customer a blend of the sharper stock ale with the fruitier, sweeter mild ale to the customer's taste. In London especially, the aged ale would take on a tart note from a secondary fermentation with brettanomyces yeast which was present either in the pitching yeast or in the wooden equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd Hind|first=H,|title=Brewing Science and Practice: Volume II Brewing Processes|year=1940|location=London|pages=800–802}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Because of the time required for the aging process, some investors would buy mild ale from brewers, age it into old ale, and sell it at the higher price. Eventually, brewers began to keep some beer behind at the brewery, age it themselves and sell it to the pubs.  In some cases old ale was a blend of young and old. The &quot;stock ale&quot; was the brewery's very aged ale and was used to inject an &quot;old&quot; quality, and perhaps acidity to the blend.

==Winter warmer==
Winter warmer is a traditional malty-sweet [[English Strong Ale]] that is brewed in the winter months. It is usually quite dark, but not as dark as a [[stout]], with a big malt presence. Sometimes, winter warmers have a few spices, especially in the United States, although spices are not necessarily a required ingredient in a Winter Warmer.  The primary characteristic is strength;  the average alcohol content by volume ranges from 6.0% to 8.0% ABV and some Winter Warmers reach 10% ABV or more.

==Variations==

[[File:Thomas Hardy's Ale 001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Bottle of [[O'Hanlon's]] Thomas Hardy's Ale (11.7% ABV)]]

Some brewers will make a [[Beer strength|strong]] old ale for bottling. Some of these can mature for several years after bottling, and may or may not be [[bottle conditioning|bottle-conditioned]]. 

The &quot;October&quot; Keeping Ales are thought to have formed the basis for [[India Pale Ale]]s shipped by the [[British East India Company]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Another version was so-called &quot;Majority Ale,&quot; a strong ale brewed on or around the birth of a child, and intended to be drunk on the child's twenty-first birthday.&lt;ref name=harrison&gt;{{cite book |title=Old British Beers and How To Make Them |author=Dr John Harrison |isbn=0951775219 |year=2003 |publisher=Durden Park Beer Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[sussex]] breweries produce a weaker style of old ale with some resemblance to a [[mild ale]] Examples include [[King and Barnes]] (later W.J King) (4.5% ABV) and [[Harveys Brewery|Harveys']] (4.3% ABV) These are typically consumed on draught dispense.

==Examples==
Examples of old ales include:
* [[Gales Brewery|George Gale]]: Prize Old Ale
* [[Theakston Brewery|Theakston]]: Old Peculier
* [[Fuller, Smith and Turner|Fuller's]]: Vintage Ale
* [[Fuller, Smith and Turner|Fuller's]]: Golden Pride

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">[[Image:Barley wines.png|right|thumb|The colour of barley wines ranges from a translucent deep amber, to cloudy mahogany (left), to an almost opaque black (right).]]

'''Barley wine''' or '''Barleywine''' is a [[beer style]] of strong [[ale]] originating in [[England]]. The first beer to be marketed as Barley Wine was [[Bass Ale|Bass]] No. 1 Ale, around 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A dictionary of chemistry and the allied branches of other sciences, Volume (1872)|first=Henry|last=Watts}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] it was known as &quot;κρίθινος οἶνος&quot; (''krithinos oinos''), &quot;barley wine&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkri%2Fqinos κρίθινος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and it is mentioned amongst others by Greek historians [[Xenophon]] in his work ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''&lt;ref&gt; Xenophon, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0202%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D26 ''Anabasis'', 4.5.26], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polybius]] in his work ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', where he mentions that [[Scheria|Phaeacians]] kept barleywine in silver and golden [[kraters]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0233%3Abook%3D34%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D15 ''The Histories'', 34.9.15], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A barley wine typically reaches an [[ethanol|alcohol]] strength of 8 to 12% by volume and is brewed from [[Gravity (beer)|specific gravities]] as high as 1.120.  It is called a ''barley wine'' because it can be as strong as [[wine]]; but since it is made from [[grain]] rather than [[fruit]], it is, in fact, a [[beer]].

Until the introduction of amber coloured [[Whitbread]] Gold Label in the 1950s, British barley wines were always dark in colour.

The [[Anchor Brewing Company]] introduced the style to the United States in 1976 with its Old Foghorn Barleywine Style Ale.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Stett. [http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-12-25/wine/17521819_1_barley-wine-fritz-maytag-liberty-ale-maytag Rich, chewy barley wine takes time]. ''San Francisco Chronicle''. December 25 2003. Retrieved 2011-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] referred to a barley wine by [[Smithwick's]] thus: &quot;This is very distinctive, with an earthy hoppiness, a wineyness, lots of fruit and toffee flavours.&quot; He also noted that its original gravity is 1.062.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000028.html &quot;Brewery with its own abbey - it must be Ireland&quot;]  FEB 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Martyn Cornell has been quoted as saying &quot;no historically meaningful difference exists between barley wines and [[old ale]]s.&quot; He later clarified, &quot;I don’t believe there is actually any such meaningful style as 'barley wine'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Martyn. [http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2010/09/14/so-what-is-the-difference-between-barley-wine-and-old-ale/ So what IS the difference between barley wine and old ale?]. Zythophile. September 24 2010. Retrieved 2011-3-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest strength Belgian beer 'Bush' has often been said to resemble a barley wine rather than more traditional Belgian styles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''Gueuze''' (or '''Geuze''') is a type of [[lambic]], a [[Beer in Belgium|Belgian beer]]. It is made by [[Blending (alcohol production)|blending]] young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics into a new beer, which is then bottled for a second [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]].  Because the young lambic is not fully fermented, it contains fermentable [[sugar]]s, which allow the second fermentation to occur. Lambic that undergoes a second fermentation in the presence of [[Sour cherry|sour cherries]] before bottling results in [[kriek lambic]], a beer closely related to gueuze.

Since gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional [[ale]] and [[lager]] style beers.  Because aged [[hops]] are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer.  Furthermore, the wild [[yeast]]s that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, cidery, musty, sour, [[acetic acid]], [[lactic acid]] taste. Many describe the taste as sour and &quot;barnyard-like.&quot; In modern times, some brewers have added sugar to their gueuzes to sweeten them and make the beer more appealing to a wider audience. Because of its carbonation, gueuze is sometimes called &quot;[[Brussels]] [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]].&quot; 
   
Traditionally, gueuze is served in [[Wine bottle|champagne bottles]], which hold either {{convert|375|ml|USoz|}} or {{convert|750|ml|USoz|}}.

==Etymology==
There is some debate on where the word Gueuze originated. One theory is that it originated from ''Geysa'' (geyser), [[old Norse]] for ''gush'', as, during times of vigorous fermentation, Gueuze will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel.
Another theory is that it originates from ''gueuze,'' the old [[Normans|Norman]] word for [[wheat]] (which makes up a portion of the Lambic [[grist]]).

== Commercial production ==

Commercial production of gueuze commenced in the 19th century; modern breweries that produce gueuze include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12719">[[Image:Beer wuerzburger hofbraue.jpg|right|thumb|A typical pale lager - ''Würzburger Hofbräu'']]

'''Pale lager''' is a very pale to [[Gold (color)|golden]]-coloured [[beer]] with a well [[Attenuation (brewing)|attenuated body]] and a varying degree of [[Hops#Noble hops|noble hop]] bitterness. The [[brewing]] process for this beer developed in the mid 19th century when [[Gabriel Sedlmayr]] took [[pale ale]] brewing techniques back to the [[Spaten Brewery]] in Germany and applied it to existing [[lagering]] methods. This approach was picked up by other brewers, most notably [[Josef Groll]] of [[Bavaria]] who produced [[Pilsner Urquell]] in the city of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], now in the [[Czech Republic]]. The resulting pale coloured, lean and stable beers were very successful and gradually spread around the globe to become the most common form of beer consumed in the world today.

== History ==

[[Bavaria]]n [[brewery|brewers]] in the sixteenth century were required by law to brew beer only during the cooler months of the year. In order to have beer available during the hot summer months, beers would be stored in caves and stone cellars, often under blocks of ice.

In the period 1820-1830, a brewer named [[Gabriel Sedlmayr]] II the Younger, whose family was running the [[Spaten Brewery]] in [[Bavaria]] went around Europe to improve his brewing skills. When he returned, he used what he had learned to get a more stable and consistent lager beer. The Bavarian lager was still different from the widely-known modern lager; due to the use of dark malts it was quite dark, representing what is now called [[Dunkel]] beer or the stronger variety, [[Bock]] beer.

The new recipe of the improved lager beer spread quickly over Europe. In particular Sedlmayr's friend [[Anton Dreher]] used the new lagering technique to improve the [[Vienna|Viennese]] beer in 1840&amp;ndash;1841, creating [[Vienna lager]]. New kilning techniques enabled the use of lighter malts, giving the beer an amber-red rich colour.

== Description ==

Pale lagers tend to be dry, lean, clean-tasting and crisp. Flavours may be subtle, with no traditional beer ingredient dominating the others. [[Hops|Hop]] character (bitterness, flavour, and aroma) ranges from negligible to a dry bitterness from [[noble hops]]. The main ingredients are water, [[Pilsner malt]] and [[noble hops]], though some brewers use [[adjuncts]] such as [[rice]] or [[maize|corn]] to lighten the body of the beer. There tends to be no [[butterscotch]] flavour from [[diacetyl]], due to the slow, cold fermentation process.

== Variations ==

Pale lager was developed in the mid 19th century when Gabriel Sedlmayr took some British [[pale ale]] brewing techniques back to the Spaten Brewery in Germany, and started to modernise continental brewing methods. In 1842 [[Josef Groll]] of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]], a city in western [[Bohemia]] in what is now the [[Czech Republic]], used some of these methods to produce ''[[Pilsner Urquell]]'', the first known example of a golden lager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000255.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - The birth of lager&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This beer proved so successful that other breweries followed the trend, using the name [[Pilsner]]. Breweries now use the terms &quot;lager&quot; and &quot;Pilsner&quot; interchangeably, though pale lagers from Germany and the Czech Republic with the name Pilsner tend to have more evident noble hop aroma and dry finish than other pale lagers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/pilsener.pilsner.pils.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Beer Styles: Pilsener/Pilsner/Pils&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beer-pages.co.uk/stories/complete-guide-beer.htm beer-pages.com - Roger Protz Complete Guide to World Beer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of Pilsen's golden beer, the town of [[Dortmund]] in Germany started brewing pale lager in 1873. As Dortmund was a major brewing centre, and the town breweries grouped together to export the beer beyond the town, the brand name
''[[Dortmunder Export]]'' became known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/dortmund.htm beer-pages.com - all you need to know about beer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, breweries in Denmark, the Netherlands, and North America brew pale lagers labelled as Dortmunder Export.

[[Image:Helles im Glas-Helles (pale beer).jpg|right|thumb|150px|A glass of helles]]

A little later, in 1894, the Spaten Brewery in [[Munich]] recognised the success of these golden lagers and utilised the methods that Sedlmayr had brought home over 50 years earlier to produce their own light lager they named helles, which is German for &quot;light coloured&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanbeerinstitute.com/helles.html Helles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanbeerguide.co.uk/helles.html German Beer Guide: Münchner Helles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to distinguish it from [[dunkel]]bier or [[dunkles]] bier (&quot;dark beer&quot;), which is another type of beer typical for the region, being darker in colour and sweeter than helles.

Examples of helles include ''[[Löwenbräu]] Original'', ''[[Spaten]] Premium Lager'', ''[[Weihenstephan]]er Original Bayrisch Mild'', ''[[Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München|Hofbräu]] München Original'', ''[[Augustiner Bräu]] Lagerbier Hell'' and ''[[Hacker-Pschorr]] Münchner Helles''. 

The earliest known brewing of [[American-style Lager|American lager]] was in the Old City section of [[Philadelphia]] by John Wagner in 1840 using yeast from his native [[Bavaria]]. Modern American-style lagers are usually made by large breweries such as [[Anheuser-Busch]]. Lightness of body is a cardinal virtue, both by design and since it allows the use of a high percentage of rice or [[maize|corn]]. 

Though all lagers are well attenuated, a more fully fermented pale lager in Germany goes by the name ''Diet Pils''. &quot;Diet&quot; in the instance not referring to being &quot;light&quot; in calories or body, rather its sugars are fully fermented into alcohol, allowing the beer to be targeted to diabetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/diat_pils.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Beer Styles: Diat Pils&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   A marketing term for a fully attenuated pale lager, originally used in Japan by [[Asahi Breweries]] in 1987, {{Nihongo|&quot;karakuchi&quot;|辛口|dry}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahibeer.co.jp/english/products/development1.html#02 Asahi Breweries | Products | Asahi Super Dry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the American brewer [[Anheuser-Busch]] in 1988 as &quot;dry beer&quot; for the Michelob brand, ''Michelob Dry''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Van Munching, Beer Blast, pp 232-233, 1997, ISBN 0-8129-6391-1&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by other &quot;dry beer&quot; brands such as [[Bud Dry]], though the marketing concept was not considered a success.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Van Munching, Beer Blast, pp 233-235, 1997, ISBN 0-8129-6391-1&lt;/ref&gt; In fully attenuated pale lagers, nearly all the sugar is converted to [[ethanol|alcohol]] due to the long fermentation period. The resulting clean, lean flavour is referred to as &quot;dry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/dry_beer.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Beer Styles: Dry Beer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Premium lager ===
Premium lager is a marketing term sometimes used by brewers for products they wish to promote; there is no legal definition for such a product, but it is usually applied to an all malt product of around 5% abv. Anheuser-Busch also uses the terms &quot;sub-premium&quot; and &quot;super-premium&quot; to describe the low-end [[Busch Beer|Busch]] beer and the slightly higher-end [[Michelob]].

Spezial is a stronger style of pale lager, mostly brewed in Southern [[Germany]], but also found in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Spezial slots in between helles and [[bock]] in terms of flavour characteristics and strength. Full-bodied and bittersweet, it is delicately spiced with German aroma hops. It has a gravity of between 12.5° and 13.5° Plato and an alcohol content of 5.5 - 5.8% abv. The style has been in slow decline over the last 30 years, but still accounts for around 10% of beer sales in [[Bavaria]].

== Strong lager ==
Pale lagers that exceed an [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] of around 5.8% are variously termed [[bock]], [[malt liquor]], super strength lager, Oktoberfestbier/Märzen, or European strong lager.

===Bock===
{{Main|Bock}}
Bock is a strong lager which has origins in the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] town [[Einbeck]], [[Germany]]. The name is a [[Corruption (grammar)|corruption]] of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] German brewing town of [[Einbeck]], but also means goat (buck) in German. The original bocks were dark beers, brewed from high-coloured [[malt]]s. Modern bocks can be dark, amber or pale in colour. Bock was traditionally brewed for special occasions, often religious festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] or [[Lent]].

===Malt liquor===
{{Main|Malt liquor}}
Malt liquor is an American term referring to a strong pale lager. In the UK, similarly-made beverages are called super-strength lager.

=== Oktoberfestbier / Märzen===
[[Oktoberfest]] is a Bavarian festival dating from 1810, and [[Märzen]] are the beers that have been served at the event in Munich since 1818, and are supplied by 6 breweries: [[Spaten]], [[Löwenbräu]], [[Augustiner Bräu|Augustiner-Bräu]], [[Hofbräuhaus|Hofbräu-München]], [[Paulaner]] and [[Hacker-Pschorr]]. Only beers that are brewed within the borders of the city of Munich are permitted to be sold at the original Oktoberfest. 
Criteria for Oktoberfest
To be served at the festival, beer must meet these criteria:
*adhere to the [[Purity Law]];
*have an original gravity between 13.5º and 14º Plato (about 6% alc.);
*be brewed by a Munich Company located within the city limits of Munich.
Upon passing these criteria, a beer is designated [[Oktoberfest Beer]].

Oktoberfest beer is also a [[registered trademark]] of the Club of Munich Brewers. It is also known as ''Münchner Bier'' (Munich Beer).[[File:Muenchner Reinheitsgebot.JPG|thumb|100px|Münchner Reinheitsgebot]]. Bavarian beer (''Bayrisches Bier'') and beers produced in Munich (''Münchner Bier'') are protected by the European Union as a PGI [[Protected Geographical Indication]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally Oktoberfestbiers were lagers of around 5.5 to 6% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] called Märzen - brewed in March and allowed to ferment slowly during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Originally these would have been dark lagers, but from 1872 a strong March brewed version of an amber-red [[Vienna lager]] made by Josef Sedlmayr became the favourite Oktoberfestbier.
Since the 1970s the type of beer served at the festival has been a pale Märzen of 13.5 to 14º Plato and 5.5% to 6% abv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The colour of these lagers may range from pale yellow to deep amber, with the darker colours more common in the USA. Hop levels tend not to be distinctive, though some USA examples may be firmly hopped. Modern beers sold as Oktoberfest and Märzen in Europe are mostly pale in colour.

[[File:Saison.jpg|thumb|[[Dupont Biolégère]], a traditional 3.5% abv saison]]

'''Saison''' ([[French language|French]], &quot;season&quot;) is the name originally given to low-alcohol [[pale ale]]s brewed seasonally in farmhouses in [[Wallonia]], the French-speaking region of [[Belgium]], for farm workers during harvest season {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Modern-day saisons are also brewed in other countries, particularly the USA, and are generally [[bottle conditioned]], with an average range of 5 to 8% abv,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-07-06

|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though saisons at the more traditional 3.5% strength can still be found.

Although saison has been described as an endangered style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutbeer.com/style/24.4-saison.html |title=Saison |publisher=www.allaboutbeer.com |accessdate=2009-10-17 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a rise in interest in this style in recent years, with [[Dupont Brewery#Beers|Saison Dupont]] being named “the Best Beer in the World” by the magazine ''[[Men’s Journal]]'' in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, saisons did not share identifiable characteristics to pin them down as a style, but rather were a group of refreshing summer ales. Each farm brewer would make his own distinctive version.&lt;ref&gt;''Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the European Tradition'', page 98, Phil Markowski, Brewers Publications (2004), ISBN 0937381845&lt;/ref&gt; Modern saisons brewed in the USA tend to copy the yeast used by [[Dupont Brewery|Brasserie Dupont]], which ferments better at warmer temperatures—{{Convert|29|to|35|C|F|0}}—than the standard {{Convert|18|to|24|C|F|0}} fermenting temperature used by other Belgian saison brewers.&lt;ref&gt;''Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the European Tradition'', pages 168 - 173, Phil Markowski, Brewers Publications (2004), ISBN 0937381845&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2010}}
&quot;Saison&quot; is French for season, because these ales were traditionally brewed in the autumn or winter{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} for consumption during the late summer harvest for farm workers who were entitled to up to five litres throughout the workday during harvest season. Today they are brewed year round. As the saison style originated before the advent of refrigeration, Belgian brewers had to brew in autumn or winter to prevent the ale from spoiling during the storage period. After brewing, the ale was stored until the late summer harvest.  Although now most commercial examples range from 5 to 8% abv, originally saisons were meant to be refreshing and thus had alcohol levels less than 3%. Because of the lack of potable water, saisons would give the farm hands the hydration they needed without the threat of illness.

The ale had to be strong to prevent spoilage during the long storage, but at the same time could not be so strong as to incapacitate the workers.  Additionally, these beers were strongly hopped, as [[hops]] act as a preservative and have antiseptic properties.  Saisons brewed in early Spring would often be blended with saisons brewed the previous Autumn, or even blended with [[lambic]] beers to increase the refreshing acidity of these beers{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Blending also occurred to reduce the abv, and thus increase its refreshment value.

== Composition ==
The type of malt determines the colour of the saison, and although most saisons are of a cloudy golden colour as result of the grist being mostly pale and/or pilsner malt, the use of darker malts results in some saisons being reddish-amber.  Some recipes also use wheat. Spices such as orange zest, coriander, and ginger may be used. Some spice character may come through due to the production of [[ester]]s during fermentation at warm temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LutJAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Saison+spice+character&amp;dq=Saison+spice+character&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bbC0TJKgJY7Hswbtv52mCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |title=Farmhouse ales |page=166|author=Phil Markowski |publisher=Brewers Publications|date=2004 |accessdate=2010-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kentucky Common Beer''' is a once-popular style of [[ale]] from the area in and around [[Louisville, Kentucky]], that is rarely brewed commercially today. Cheaper than imported beers, it was popular among the working class.

It was usually made with barley and approximately 25 to 30 percent [[maize]], with some artificial coloring, [[caramel]], or roasted malt to give it a dark color. It had an [[original gravity]] of 1.040-1.050, an average bitterness of 27 [[International Bitterness Units scale|IBU]]s, and 2 percent soured malt. The soured malt was made in a [[sour mash]] with the help of ''[[Lactobacillus|Lactobacillus delbrueckii]]''.

The [[New Albanian Brewing Company]] in [[New Albany, Indiana]], features its version, Phoenix Kentucky Komon, as a rotating seasonal selection.

'''Stout''' is a dark [[beer]] made using roasted [[malt]] or roasted barley,&lt;ref name=&quot;node&quot;&gt;The New Oxford Dictionary of English. Oxford University Press 1998 ISBN 0-19-861263-X&lt;/ref&gt; [[hops]], water and yeast. Stouts were traditionally the generic term for the strongest or stoutest [[Porter (beer)|porters]], typically 7% or 8%,&lt;ref name=&quot;camra&quot;&gt;[http://www.camra.org.uk/page.php?id=231  Porter and Stout - CAMRA]&lt;/ref&gt; produced by a brewery.

There are a number of variations including [[#Baltic porter|Baltic porter]], dry stout and imperial stout. The name ''porter'' was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with street and river [[porter (carrier)|porters]] of London that had been made with roasted malts. This same beer later also became known as stout,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000041.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Porter casts a long shadow on ale history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though the word stout had been used as early as 1677.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&quot;&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0937381446?p=S003#reader-page Stout (Classic Beer Style Series, 10)]&lt;/ref&gt; The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.&lt;ref name=&quot;camra&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[Porter (beer)|Porter]] was first recorded as being made and sold in London in the 1730s, the exact origins  of which are unknown.  Large volumes were exported to [[Ireland]] where it became very popular.  Later with the advent of [[mild ale]] the popularity of dark beers decreased in [[Great Britain]], but continued to flourish in [[Ireland]] where the breweries of [[Guinness]], [[Murphy's Irish Stout|Murphy's]] and [[Beamish and Crawford|Beamish]] grew in size thanks to international interest in Irish (or dry) stout.  In the 19th century, the beer gained its customary black colour through the use of [[Black_patent_malt#Black_malt|black patent malt]], and became stronger in flavour.&lt;ref name=&quot;camra&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Nourishing&quot; and sweet &quot;milk&quot; stouts became popular in Great Britain in the years following the [[First World War]], though their popularity declined towards the end of the 20th century, apart from pockets of local interest such as in Glasgow with Sweetheart Stout.

With beer writers such as [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] writing about stouts and porters in the 1970s, there has been a moderate interest in the global speciality beer market.

Originally, the adjective ''stout'' meant &quot;proud&quot; or &quot;brave&quot;, but later, after the 14th century, it took on the connotation of &quot;strong&quot;. The first known use of the word ''stout'' for beer was in a document dated 1677 found in the [[Francis Egerton, 8th Earl of Bridgewater|Egerton]] Manuscript,&lt;ref name=&quot;E&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0937381446?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S003#reader-page&lt;/ref&gt; the sense being that a stout beer was a strong beer. The expression ''stout porter'' was applied during the 18th century to strong versions of porter, and was used by [[Guinness]] of Ireland in 1820 &amp;ndash; although Guinness had been brewing porters since about 1780, having originally been an ale brewer from its foundation in 1759. ''Stout'' still meant only &quot;strong&quot; and it could be related to any kind of beer, as long as it was strong: in the UK it was possible to find &quot;stout pale ale&quot;, for example. Later, ''stout'' was eventually to be associated only with [[porter (beer)|porter]], becoming a synonym of dark beer. During the last part of the 19th century, stout porter beer gained the reputation of being a healthful, strengthening drink, so that it was used by athletes and nursing mothers, while doctors often recommended it to help recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3266819.stm Guinness is good for you.] (13 November 2003) Health, BBC News - Retrieved on 19 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the huge popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The beers with higher gravities were called &quot;Stout Porters&quot;.  There is still division and debate on whether stouts should be a separate style from porter. Usually the only deciding factor is strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So what IS the difference between porter and stout?|url=http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/so-what-is-the-difference-between-porter-and-stout/|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of stout==
[[File:stout.jpg|thumb|right|A pint of [[Guinness]] stout.]]
Stouts have a number of variations.

===Dry or Irish stout===
[[Ireland|Irish]] stout or dry stout (in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''leann dubh'', &quot;black beer&quot;) is very dark or rich in colour and it often has a &quot;roasted&quot; or coffee-like taste. The most famous example is [[Guinness]] followed by [[Murphy's Brewery|Murphy's]] and [[Beamish Stout|Beamish]].  There are also a number of smaller craft breweries producing stout. The [[ethanol|alcoholic]] content and &quot;dry&quot; flavour of a dry or Irish stout are both characterised as light, although it varies from country to country.

===Imperial stout===
Imperial stout, also known as &quot;Russian imperial stout&quot; or &quot;imperial Russian stout,&quot; is a strong dark beer or stout in the style that was brewed in the 18th century by Thrale's brewery in London, [[England]] for export to the court of [[Catherine II of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A draught of contentment: the story of the Courage Group|author=John Pudney|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781 the brewery changed hands and the beer became known as Barclay Perkins Imperial Brown Stout.  When the brewery was taken over by [[Courage Brewery|Courage]] the beer was renamed Courage Imperial Russian Stout.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has a high [[alcohol]] content, usually over 9 % [[Alcohol by volume|abv]].

===Porter===
{{main|Porter (beer)}}
While there is a great deal of disagreement in the brewing world on this subject, at one time, porter was considered an alternative name for stout. It was originally used in the 18th century. Historically, there are no differences between stout and porter, though there has been a tendency for breweries to differentiate the strengths of their dark beers with the words &quot;extra&quot;, &quot;double&quot; and &quot;stout&quot;. The term ''stout'' was initially used to indicate a stronger porter than other porters issued by an individual brewery. Though not consistent, this is the usage that was most commonly employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180680 Porter and Stout - CAMRA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic porter===
A version of [[#Imperial Stout|Imperial Stout]] which originated in the [[Baltic region]], usually [[cold fermented]].  Imperial Stouts exported from Britain in the 18th century were popular in the Baltic region, and were produced locally using local ingredients and brewing traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutbeer.com/style/23.2-balticporter.html Baltic Porters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milk stout===
Milk stout (also called sweet stout or cream stout) is a stout containing [[lactose]], a [[sugar]] derived from [[milk]]. Because lactose is unfermentable by [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|beer yeast]], it adds sweetness, body, and calories to the finished beer. Milk stout was claimed to be nutritious, and was given to nursing mothers,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for which the original brewers claimed that &quot;each pint contains the energising carbohydrates of 10 ounces of pure dairy milk&quot;. In the period just after the Second World War when [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] was in place, the British government required brewers to remove the word &quot;milk&quot; from labels and adverts, and any imagery associated with milk.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Protz, ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Beer'', page 100, Carlton Books, 1995, ISBN 1-85375-197-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oatmeal stout===
[[File:SamuelSmithsOatmealStout.jpg|thumb|upright|The original modern oatmeal stout]]

Oatmeal stout is a stout with a proportion of [[oat]]s, normally a maximum of 30%, added during the brewing process. Even though a larger proportion of oats in beer can lead to a bitter or astringent taste,&lt;ref&gt;Page 50, ''Stout'', Michael J. Lewis, published 1995 by Brewers Publications, ISBN 0-937381-44-6&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[medieval]] period in Europe, oats were a common ingredient in ale,&lt;ref&gt;Page 49, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, ISBN 0-7553-1164-7&lt;/ref&gt; and proportions up to 35% were standard. However, despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use of oats in brewing until the early part of the 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 [[Tudor period|Tudor]] sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour.&lt;ref&gt;Page 78, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, ISBN 0-7553-1164-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/2914008, The Guide to Gentlemen and Farmers&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a revival of interest in using oats during the end of the 19th century, when (supposedly) restorative, nourishing and invalid beers, such as the later milk stout, were popular, because of the association of [[porridge]] with health.&lt;ref&gt;Page 158, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, ISBN 0-7553-1164-7&lt;/ref&gt; Maclay of Alloa produced an Original Oatmalt&lt;!--correct spelling--&gt; Stout in 1895 which used  70% &quot;oatmalt&quot;, and a 63/- Oatmeal Stout in 1909, which used 30% &quot;flaked (porridge) oats&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 59 &amp; 60, ''Old British Beers'', Dr. John Harrison, published  2003 by Durden Park Beer Circle, ISBN 0-9517752-1-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century many oatmeal stouts contained only a minimal amount of oats. For example, in 1936 Barclay Perkins Oatmeal Stout used only 0.5% oats.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay Perkins brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives&lt;/ref&gt; As the oatmeal stout was parti-gyled with their porter and standard stout, these two also contained the same proportion of oats. The name seems to have been a marketing device more than anything else. In the 1920s and 1930s Whitbread's London Stout and Oatmeal Stout were identical, just packaged differently. The amount of oats Whitbread used was minimal, again just around 0.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Whitbread brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives&lt;/ref&gt; With such a small quantity of oats used, it could have had little impact on the flavour or texture of these beers.

Many breweries were still brewing oatmeal stouts in the 1950s, for example Brickwoods in Portsmouth, Matthew Brown in Blackburn and Ushers in Trowbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Whitbread Gravity Book, Whitbread Archive in the London Metropolitan Archives&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] mentioned the defunct Eldrige Pope &quot;Oat Malt Stout&quot; in his 1977 book ''The World Guide to Beer'', oatmeal stout was no longer being made anywhere, but Charles Finkel, founder of [[Merchant du Vin]], was curious enough to commission [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith]] to produce a version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001674.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Kisses, oats and stouts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout then became the template for other breweries' versions.


Oatmeal stouts usually do not specifically taste of oats. The smoothness of oatmeal stouts comes from the high content of proteins, lipids (includes fats and waxes), and gums imparted by the use of oats. The gums increase the viscosity and body adding to the sense of smoothness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.byo.com/stories/beer-styles/article/indices/11-beer-styles/1194-oatmeal-stout-style |title=Brew Your Own: The How-To Homebrew Beer Magazine - Beer Styles - Oatmeal Stout |first=Stephan  |last=Galante |work=byo.com |date=October 1997 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chocolate stout===
&quot;Chocolate stout&quot; is a name brewers sometimes give to certain stouts having a noticeable dark chocolate flavour through the use of darker, more aromatic [[malt]]; particularly chocolate malt &amp;mdash; a malt that has been roasted or [[kiln]]ed until it acquires a chocolate colour. Sometimes, as with Muskoka Brewery's Double Chocolate Cranberry Stout, [[Young's]] Double Chocolate Stout, and [[Rogue Ales|Rogue Brewery's]] Chocolate Stout, the beers are also brewed with a small amount of actual chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngs.co.uk/ProductPage.aspx?pageID=11&amp;&amp;productID=6 Young's - our beer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogue.com/beers/chocolate-stout.php rogue.com : Rogue Brews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coffee stout===
Dark roasted [[malt]]s, such as black patent malt (the darkest roast), can lend a bitter coffee flavour to dark beer. Some brewers like to emphasize the coffee flavour and add ground coffee. Brewers will often give these beers names such as &quot;Guatemalan Coffee Stout&quot;, &quot;Espresso Stout&quot;, &quot;Breakfast Coffee Stout&quot;, &quot;Stir Stick Stout&quot;, etc.

The [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] of these coffee flavoured stouts will vary from under 4% to over 8%. Most examples will be dry and bitter, though others add milk sugar to create a sweet stout which may then be given a name such as &quot;Coffee &amp; Cream Stout&quot; or just &quot;Coffee Cream Stout&quot;. Other flavours such as mint or chocolate may also be added in various combinations.
[[File:Marston's Oyster Stout 01.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bottle of [[Marston's]] Oyster Stout]]

===Oyster stout===
[[Oyster]]s have had a long association with stout. When stouts were emerging in the 18th century, oysters were a commonplace food often served in [[public house]]s and taverns. [[Benjamin Disraeli]] is said{{By whom|date=November 2010}} to have enjoyed a meal of oysters and [[Guinness]] in the 19th century, though by the 20th century oyster beds were in decline, and stout had given way to [[pale ale]].

The first known use of oysters as part of the brewing process of stout was in 1929 in [[New Zealand]], followed by the Hammerton Brewery in London, UK, in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000740.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Heaven sent - downing oysters by the pint&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several British brewers used oysters in stouts during the &quot;nourishing stout&quot; and &quot;milk stout&quot; period just after the Second World War.

Modern oyster stouts may be made with a handful of oysters in the barrel. Hence the claim of one [[Dublin]] establishment the [[Porterhouse Brewery]] that their award winning Oyster Stout was not suitable for vegetarians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.porterhousebrewco.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Marston's]] Oyster Stout, just use the name with the implication that the beer would be suitable for drinking with oysters.

'''Framboise''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃bwaz}}) is the [[French language|French]] word for [[raspberry]], and is often used to refer to alcohol distilled with the fruit. 

==Beer==
Primarily framboise is used in reference to a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[lambic]] [[beer]] that is fermented using raspberries, and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is referred to as '''Frambozenbier'''. It is one of many modern fruitbeer types that have been inspired by the more traditional [[Kriek (lambic)|kriek]] beer, made using [[sour cherry|sour cherries]]. 

Framboise is usually served in a small glass that resembles a champagne glass, only shorter (could also be a goblet). Most framboise beers are quite sweet, though the [[Cantillon Brewery|Cantillon brewery]] produces a tart version called ''Rosé de [[Gambrinus]]'' that is based on the traditional kriek style. The [[Liefmans]] brewery uses [[Oud bruin]] beer instead of lambic to make its high quality framboise beer, resulting in a very different taste. Recently, Framboise has become popular outside of Belgium, and can now be found in pubs and supermarkets all over the world.  

==Eau de vie==
Framboise is also commonly used to refer to [[eau de vie]] distilled with raspberries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ned Halley|title=Dictionary of Drink|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=978-1-84022-302-6|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GravityTap.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rauchbier]], a smokey style of beer]]
'''Beer style''' is a term used to differentiate and categorize [[beer]]s by various factors such as colour, flavour, strength, ingredients, production method, recipe, history, or origin.

The modern concept of beer style is largely based on the work of writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] in his 1977 book ''The World Guide To Beer'' in which he categorised a variety of beers from around the world into local style groups according to local customs and names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000233.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - How to save a beer style&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, [[Fred Eckhardt]] furthered Jackson's work publishing ''The Essentials of Beer Style''.&lt;ref name='Eckhardt'&gt;{{cite book | last = Eckhardt | first = Fred | authorlink = Fred Eckhardt | coauthors = | title = The Essentials of Beer Style: A Catalog of Classic Beer Styles for Brewers and Beer Enthusiasts | publisher = Fred Eckhardt Communications | year = 1993 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0960630271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the systematic study of beer styles is a modern phenomenon, the practice of distinguishing between different varieties of beer is ancient, dating to at least 2000 BC.

The study of what constitutes a beer's style may involve provenance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?ei=LIC9TZaxE9_V4wbHyunTBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=NuFJAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=beer+style+provenance&amp;q=provenance#search_anchor |title=Michael Jackson's beer companion:the world's great beer styles, gastronomy, and traditions |author=Michael Jackson|page=45 &amp; 118|publisher=Running Press, 1997 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |authorlink= Michael Jackson (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; local tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=L3SU4ahY-m4C&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22beer+style%22+local+tradition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y4K9TbGFJcje4waWuNnABQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Brewing yeast and fermentation

== Types==

[[brewers yeast|Yeasts]] that ferment at relatively warmer temperatures, usually between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, form a layer of foam on the surface of the fermenting beer, which is why they are referred to as [[top-fermenting yeast]]s. Yeasts that ferment at considerably lower temperatures, around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, have the ability to process a chemical compound known as [[raffinose]], a complex sugar created during fermentation. These yeasts collect at the bottom of the fermenting beer and are therefore referred to as [[bottom-fermenting yeast]]. The majority of beer in production today is fermented in this way and is called [[lager]].&lt;ref name=ref-12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/bot135/lect14.htm |title=Yeast and Alcoholic Beverages: Beer, Wine and Liquor |work=Welcome to University of Hawaii at Manoa Botany |publisher=University of Hawaii |accessdate=9 Nov. 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other types of beer styles include beer of spontaneous fermentation and beers of mixed origin. Beers of spontaneous fermentation are mainly produced in [[Beer in Belgium|Belgium]] using wild strains of yeast. These types of beers are often referred to as [[Lambic]]. Beers of mixed origin include [[Altbier]] and [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]].&lt;ref name=ref-12/&gt;

==History of beer styles==
{{See also|History of beer}}
The history of beer style would be the [[history of beer]] itself. The Alulu Tablet, a [[Sumer|Sumerian]] receipt for &quot;best&quot; ale written in [[Cuneiform]] found in [[Ur]], suggests that even in 2050 BC there was a differentiation between at least two different types or qualities of ale. The work of [[Bedrich Hrozny]] on translating [[Assyria]]n merchants' tablets found in [[Hattusa]], revealed that approximately 500 years later the [[Hittites]] had over 15 different types of beer.

Documents in various countries over the years reveal comments on different local brewing methods or ingredients. [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]'' wrote about [[Celts]] brewing ale &quot;in Gaul and Spain in a number of different ways, and under a number of different names; although the principle is the same.&quot; [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] laws reveal they identified three different ales, while the [[Normans]] mention ''cervisae'' (ale) and ''plena cervisia'' (full bodied ale) in the [[Domesday Book]].

By the 15th century brewers in Germany and the [[Low Countries]] were using [[hops]] to flavour and preserve their ale; this new style of ale was called beer. When this trend came to Britain and brewers of beer in [[Southwark]], [[London]], started to take sales away from the traditional brewers of unhopped ale, there were complaints and protests. Various laws were passed favouring either beer or ale for a number of years, until hopped beer became the standard style throughout Europe.

Also in the 15th century, brewers in [[Bavaria]] were storing beer in cool caves during the summer months in order to stop it spoiling. The beer became known as [[lager]] from the German word ''lagern'', meaning &quot;to store&quot;.

Although beers using naturally dried [[malt]] would have been pale-coloured, by the 17th century most malts in Europe would have been dried over a fire, resulting in a dark coloured beer. When [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] started to be used for roasting malt in 1642, the resulting lighter coloured beers became very popular. By 1703 the term ''[[pale ale]]'' was starting to be used, though the beer it described was a lightly hopped ale, very different from more bitter modern versions.

However, despite an awareness by commentators, law-makers, and brewers that there were different styles of beer, it wasn't until Michael Jackson's ''World Guide To Beer'' was published in 1977 that there was an attempt to group together and compare beers from around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;/&gt; Jackson's book had a particular influence in North America where the writer [[Fred Eckhardt]] was also starting to explore the nature of beer styles. The wine importing company [[Merchant du Vin]] switched to importing beers mentioned in Jackson's book. Small brewers started up, producing copies and interpretations of the beer styles Jackson described.

While North America developed beer styles into a serious study with fixed parameters of [[IBUs|bitterness]], [[Standard Reference Method|colour]], aroma, yeast, ingredients and strength, other countries continued to mainly categorise beers loosely by strength and colour, with much overlapping of naming conventions.

==Elements of beer style==
Beers may be categorized based on a number of factors.

===Appearance===
{| align=&quot;right&quot; cellpadding=10
|{{Beer color}}
|}
The visual characteristics that may be observed in a beer are colour, clarity, and nature of the head. Colour is usually imparted by the malts used, notably the adjunct malts added to darker beers, though other ingredients may contribute to the colour of some styles such as fruit beers. Colour intensity can be measured by systems such as [[European Brewery Convention|EBC]], [[Standard Reference Method|SRM]] or [[degrees Lovibond|Lovibond]], but this information is rarely given to the public.

Many beers are [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]], but some beers, such as [[hefeweizen]], may be cloudy due to the presence of yeast making them [[translucent]]. A third variety is the [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] or near-opaque colour that exists with [[stout]]s, [[Porter (beer)|porter]]s, [[schwarzbier]]s (black beer) and other deeply coloured styles. Thickness and retention of the [[Beer head|head]] and the lace it can leave on the glass, are also factors in a beer's appearance.

===Aroma===
The aroma in a beer may be formed from the malt and other fermentables, the strength and type of hops, the alcohol, [[ester]]s, and various other aromatic components that can be contributed by the yeast strain, and other elements that may derive from the water and the brewing process.

===Flavour===
The taste characteristics of a beer may come from the type and amount of [[malt]] used, flavours imparted by the [[yeast]], and strength of bitterness. Bitterness can be measured on an [[International Bitterness Units scale]], and in North America a number of brewers record the bitterness on this scale as IBUs.

===Mouthfeel===
The feel of a beer in the mouth, both from thickness of the liquid and from carbonation, may also be considered as part of a beer's style. A more dextrinous beer feels thicker in the mouth. The level of carbonation (or nitrogen, in &quot;smooth&quot; beers) varies from one beer style to another. For some beers it may give the beer a thick and creamy feel, while for others it contributes a prickly sensation.

===Strength===
The ''strength'' of beer is a general term for the amount of [[ethanol|alcohol]] present. It can be quantified either indirectly by measurement of [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|specific gravity]], or more directly by determining the overall percentage of alcohol in the beer.

==== Gravity ====
{{main|Gravity (alcoholic beverage)}}
Measurement of the [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|specific gravity]] of the beer has traditionally been used as an to estimate the strength of beer by measuring its density. Historically, several different scales have been used for the measurement of gravity, including the [[Plato scale|Plato]], [[Baumé scale|Baumé]], [[Balling scale|Balling]], and [[Brix|Brix scale]]s, with the Plato scale being the most common contemporary measure.

This approach relies on the fact that dissolved sugars and alcohol each affect the density of beer differently. Since sugars are converted to alcohol during the process of [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermentation]], gravity can be used to estimate the final alcohol. In beer brewing, a distinction is made between the ''original gravity'', the gravity of the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]] before fermentation has begun, and the ''final gravity'' of the product when fermentation has completed. Since the concentration of sugars is directly proportional to the gravity, the original gravity gives a brewer an idea of the potential alcoholic strength of the final product. After fermentation, the differences between the final and original gravities indicates the amount of sugar converted into alcohol, allowing the concentration of alcoholic strength to be calculated.

The original gravity of a beer was the basis for determining taxation in both the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]] from 1880 until the late 20th century, and a legacy of that system remains in the largely arbitrary division of [[bitter (beer)|bitter]] into &quot;bitter&quot;, &quot;best bitter&quot;, and &quot;special bitter&quot; substyles. In [[continental Europe]], the strength of a beer in degrees Plato is sometimes used by a brewery to distinguish a particular beer produced in a line. For example, [[Rochefort Brewery]] produces three beers, all dissimilar in colour, flavour, and aroma; and sells them as Rochefort 6, Rochefort 8, and Rochefort 10, the numbers referring to the original gravities of the beers. [[Westvleteren Brewery]], meanwhile, produces three beers, and calls them Blonde, 8, and 12.

==== Alcohol concentration ====
{{See also|Beer measurement#By strength}}
Modern classification of the strength of alcoholic beverages for the purposes of taxation and regulation typically discriminates according to the percentage of [[alcohol by volume]], generally abbreviated as abv. Additionally, although less common, some brewers throughout the world use also [[Concentration#Mass percentage (fraction)|alcohol by weight]] (abw),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://beeradvocate.com/articles/518|title=BeerAdvocate: Get to Know Your Alcohol (By Volume) | publisher=BeerAdvocate.com | accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly on [[Low-alcohol beer#Low-point beer (3.2%)|low-point]] versions of popular domestic beer brands. At the relatively low alcohol concentrations of beer, the alcohol percentage by weight is roughly 4/5 of the abv (e.g., 3.2% abw is equivalent to 4.0% abv),&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-07-05
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but this becomes increasingly inaccurate as the alcohol concentration increases.

Before the development of modern brewing practices and the complete understanding of the [[biochemistry]] of yeast, the final abv of a beer could not be precisely controlled, making its value inconsistent and therefore unsuitable as a determinant for taxation or regulation. Contemporarily, though, abv is often used in to determine the [[duty (economics)|duty]] on beer and [[cider]], and sales of beer and cider above a certain abv is sometimes restricted or prohibited. For example, in [[Texas]], beers below 4% abv cannot be sold as [[stout]] regardless of other stylistic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerscribe.com/labels.html Andy Crouch's BeerScribe.com - Beer Labels and Packaging&lt;!-- Note: update ref to point to the actual law, if it's online --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeast===
A variety of yeasts are used in making beer, most of which are strains of either [[top-fermenting yeast]] or [[bottom-fermenting yeast]]. Different strains impart different flavour and aroma characteristics,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and may vary in which complex sugars they can ferment and how high their alcohol tolerance is, both of which are factors in attenuation. Some beers use other microbes in addition to yeasts, such as [[Lactobacillus]] or [[Brettanomyces]]. For example, the distinctive flavour and aroma of Belgian Abbey ales largely result from the yeast strains used to ferment the beer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There are a few modern styles, notably [[lambic]]s, where [[spontaneous fermentation]] is used — that is, rather than being inoculated in a controlled fashion with a nurtured yeast, the unfermented wort is allowed to be colonized by microorganisms present in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=hHVmBknpMW8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=microorganisms+present+in+the+environment+lambic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kIi9TfC3L9Ss8QPF25zVBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Beverages: Technology, Chemistry and Microbiology |page=323|author=Alan H. Varnam, J. M. Sutherland|publisher=Springer, 1994|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grains===
{{details|Mash ingredients|grains as style determinants}}

Most beers use barley malt as their primary source of fermentable sugars, and some beer styles mandate it be used exclusively, such as those German styles developed under [[Reinheitsgebot]]. Some beer styles can be considered [[varietals]], in the same sense as wine, based on their malt bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Kiln]]ed [[pale malt]]s form the basis of most beer styles now in production, with styles that use other grains as a base distinguished by those grains (for example [[bock]], which uses Munich malt as a base). The [[Rauchbier]] and [[Alaskan smoked porter]] styles are distinguished by the use of smoked malt.

Some styles use one or more other grains as a key ingredient in the style, such as [[wheat beer]], [[rye beer]], or [[oatmeal stout]].

The inclusion of some grains such as [[maize|corn]] and [[rice]] is often viewed as making less of a flavour contribution and more of an added source of fermentable sugars. Rice in particular &quot;is considered by many [craft] brewers what the nasty industrial brewers use to water down their beer&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Ogle&quot;&gt;{{cite book

. This is due in large part to the use of rice by large scale American breweries. While it is commonly held that these breweries introduced these grains to their formulas during war shortages, author Maureen Ogle states &quot;The mythology is that these giant beer makers began adding rice and corn to their beer after World War II to water it down, but that's simply not true. The American brewing industry was built in the late 19th century by first-generation German American immigrants such as Adolphus Busch, Adolph Coors and Frederick Miller. Although these men, craft brewers themselves, initially re-created the full-bodied beers of their homeland, many Americans had not developed a taste for the malt-heavy style. They needed a domestic ingredient that would make the beers more effervescent, bubbly and lighter. Rice and corn did that &amp;ndash; it was a desired flavor, not inexpensive filler.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogle&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--rice is a domestic US ingredient?--&gt;

===Hops===
[[Hops]] contribute bitterness, flavour and aroma to a beer in different ways depending on when they are added during the brewing process. How much hop bitterness and aroma is appropriate varies considerably between different beer styles. There are many varieties of hops, some of which are associated with beers from specific regions. For example, Saaz hops are associated with Czech Pilsners; Hallertau and Tettnanger are two of the &quot;noble&quot; [[List of hop varieties|hop varieties]] one expects to find in German beers, and Kent Goldings are an English variety.

===Water===
Water is the main ingredient in beer, and, though water itself is flavourless, the [[Water_%28molecule%29#Chemical_and_physical_properties|chemical composition]] can have an influence on the finished taste; indeed, some brewers regard it as &quot;the most important ingredient in beer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellsandyoungs.co.uk/wellsandyoungs/beers/ales/wells-bombardier Wells Bombardier Bitter - Wells &amp; Young's Brewing Company Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, two styles of beer are especially noted for their water chemistry: [[pale ale]], for which the process of [[Burtonisation]] is widespread; and [[Pilsener]].

===Other ingredients===
Fruits and spices are key ingredients in some beer styles. While fruit beers and herb beers are often listed as style categories unto themselves, fruits and spices are sometimes used to contribute to the flavour and aroma profile of other styles. Vegetables have also been used in beers. Honey, molasses, candy sugar, or other fermentable sugars may be added to impart their distinct flavours to a beer. While not an ingredient per se, some brewers have experimented with aging their beer in barrels previously used for [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] or other distilled spirits, imparting the flavour of both the wood and the spirit to the beer.

Alcoholic beverages made from the fermentation of sugars derived from non-grain sources are generally not called &quot;beer,&quot; despite being produced by the same [[yeast]]-based biochemical reaction. Fermented honey is called ''[[mead]]'', fermented apple juice is called ''[[cider]]'', fermented pear juice is called ''[[perry]]'' (sometimes, ''pear cider''), fermented plum juice is called ''[[plum jerkum]]'', and fermented grape juice is called ''[[wine]]''. Chinese ''[[Rice wine|jiu]]'' and Japanese ''[[sake]]'' are made using much the same process as beer with one additional step in the fermentation as well as using rice instead of primarily barley malt.

==Beer styles==
Most beer styles fall into broad types roughly according to the time and temperature of the primary fermentation and the variety of yeast used during fermentation. As the terminology of brewing arose before the advent of the science of microbiology, &quot;yeast&quot; in this context may refer not only to [[fungi]] but to some [[bacteria]], for example ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' in [[Berliner Weisse]].

[[Top-fermenting yeast]] typically ferments at higher temperatures (15&amp;ndash;23°C, 60&amp;ndash;75°F), producing significant amounts of [[ester]]s and other secondary flavours and aromas, often resembling those of apple, pear, pineapple, grass, hay, banana, plum or prune.

Top-fermented beers include [[Brown Ale]], [[Mild ale|Mild Ale]], [[Old Ale]], [[Pale Ale]], [[Stout]] and [[Wheat beer]].

[[Pale lager]]s are the most commonly consumed type of beer in the world. Lagers are of [[Central Europe]]an origin, taking their name from the [[German language|German]] ''lagern'' (&quot;to store&quot;), and normally use a [[bottom-fermenting yeast]] which begin fermenting at {{convert|7|-|12|C|F}} (the &quot;fermentation phase&quot;), and then stored at {{convert|0|-|4|C|F}} (the &quot;lagering phase&quot;). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of [[ester]]s and other byproducts, resulting in a &quot;crisper&quot; tasting beer.

Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by [[Gabriel Sedlmayr]] the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the [[Spaten Brewery]] in [[Bavaria]], and [[Anton Dreher]], who began brewing a lager in [[Vienna]], Austria, in 1840&amp;ndash;1841. With modern improved fermentation control, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1&amp;ndash;3 weeks.

Most of today's lager is based on the original [[Pilsner]] style, pioneered in 1842 in the town of Pilsen ([[Plzen|Plzeň]]), in an area of the Austrian monarchy now located in the [[Czech beer|Czech Republic]]. The modern pale lager that developed from Pilsner is light in colour and high in [[forced carbonation]], with an alcohol content of 3&amp;ndash;6% [[alcohol by volume|by volume]]. The [[Pilsner Urquell]] or [[Heineken]] brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, with the Pilsner Urquell brand having a hop presence more associated with the pilsner style. Principal styles of lager include [[pale lager]], [[Bock]], [[Dunkel]], [[Helles]], [[Oktoberfestbier / Märzen]], [[Pilsner]], [[Schwarzbier]] and [[Vienna lager]].

Beers of spontaneous fermentation use wild yeasts rather than cultivated ones. By the Middle Ages, brewers had learned to crop the yeast from one brew and use it in the next. Only in a few isolated regions were wild yeasts still used. The best-known region where spontaneous fermentation is still used is the [[Zenne|Senne Valley]] in Belgium where [[lambic]] is produced.

Hybrid or mixed style beers use modern techniques and materials instead of, or in addition to, traditional aspects of brewing. Although there is some variation among sources, mixed beers generally fall into the following categories:

* [[Altbier]] and [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]], both of which are top fermented before being cold conditioned, i.e. lagered.
* [[Steam beer]]s were invented by German immigrants living in California and are made with a type of bottom-fermenting yeast that can ferment at warmer temperatures. The name &quot;steam beer&quot; is a trademark of the [[Anchor Brewing Company]], though other brewers brew this beer under the designation &quot;California common&quot;.
* [[Fruit and vegetable beer]]s are mixed with some kind of fermentable [[fruit]] or [[vegetable]] [[adjunct (beer)|adjunct]] during the fermentation process, providing obvious yet harmonious qualities.
* [[adjunct (beer)|Herb and spiced beer]]s include [[herb]]s or [[spice]]s derived from [[root]]s, [[seed]]s, fruits, vegetables or [[flower]]s instead of, or in addition to [[hops]].
* Wood-aged beers are any traditional or experimental beer that has been aged in a [[wood]]en [[barrel]] or have been left in contact with wood chips or cubes. Often, the barrel or wood will be treated first with some variety of [[Distilled beverage|spirit]] or other alcoholic beverage; [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]], [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] and [[sherry]] are common.
* [[Smoked beer]]s use malt that has been treated by [[Smoking (cooking)|exposing it to smoke]] from burning or smoldering wood so that a smoky aroma and flavour is present. The best known examples of this style are the Rauchbiers of [[Bamberg]], Germany. Brewers outside Germany have also used smoked [[malt]] in [[porter beer|porter]]s, [[Scotch ale]] and other styles.
* [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]-style beers are finished &quot;à la méthode originale&quot;, mainly in [[Beer in Belgium|Belgium]], and include Grottenbier, Deus and Malheur Bière Brut.

'''Beer style''' is a loose term used to differentiate and categorize [[beer]]s by various factors including appearance, [[flavour]], ingredients, production method, history, or origin. The term &quot;beer style&quot; and the structuring of world beers into defined categories is largely based on the work done by writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] in his 1977 book ''The World Guide To Beer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000233.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter – How to save a beer style&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fred Eckhardt]] furthered Jackson's work publishing ''The Essentials of Beer Style'' in 1989.

There is no universally agreed list of beer styles as different countries and organisations have different sets of criteria. Organisers of beer competitions such as [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]]'s [[Champion Beer of Britain#Categories|Champion Beer of Britain]], the [[Beer Judge Certification Program]]'s local [[homebrewing]] competitions, the [[Brewers Association]]'s [[World Beer Cup]], and the [[Brewing Industry International Awards]] have categories in which beers are judged. The categories are varied and include: &quot;[[Cask Conditioned Ale]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A number of ethnic beers, such as [[Chhaang]] and [[Cauim]] are not included on any of the main beer style groupings.

Some beer terms such as [[ale]], [[lager]], [[cask ale]] cover a wide variety of beer styles.

Some countries have distinctive ways of brewing.

'''India Pale Ale''' or '''IPA''' is a [[beer styles|style of beer]] within the broader category of [[pale ale]]. It was first brewed in England in the 19th century.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}

The first known use of the expression &quot;India pale ale&quot; comes from an advertisement in the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo|Liverpool Mercury]]'' newspaper published January 30, 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Pete p 426. &quot;Hops &amp; Glory: One Man's Search for the Beer That Built The British Empire&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Before January 1835, and for some time after this date, this style of beer was referred to as &quot;pale ale as prepared for India&quot;, &quot;India Ale&quot;, &quot;pale India ale&quot; or &quot;pale export India ale&quot;.

==History==
IPA descends from the earliest pale ales of the 14th century. The term pale ale originally denoted an ale which had been brewed from pale [[malt]].&lt;ref&gt;London and Country Brewer, Anonymous, 1736, pages 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The pale ales of the early 18th century were lightly hopped and quite different from later pale ales.&lt;ref&gt;London and Country Brewer, Anonymous, 1736, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-18th century, pale ale was mostly manufactured with coke-fired malt, which produced less smoking and roasting of barley in the malting process, and hence produced a paler beer.&lt;ref&gt;Foster p. 13 and Daniels p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; One such variety of beer was October beer, a pale well-hopped brew popular among the landed classes, who brewed it domestically; once brewed it was intended to cellar two years.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell p. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest known named brewers whose beers were exported to India was George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery, on the Middlesex-Essex border. Bow Brewery beers became popular among [[East India Company]] traders in the late 18th century because of the brewery's location and Hodgson's liberal credit line of 18 months. Ships transported a number of Hodgson's beers to India, among them his October beer, which benefited exceptionally from conditions of the voyage and was apparently highly regarded among its consumers in India.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Bow Brewery came into control of Hodgson's sons in the early 19th century, but their business practices alienated their customers. During the same period, several Burton breweries lost their European export market in Russia because of new tariffs on beer, and were seeking a new export market for their beer.
At the behest of the East India Company, [[Samuel Allsopp &amp; Sons|Allsopp]] brewery developed a strongly hopped pale ale in the style of Hodgson's for export to India.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, p. 26&lt;br&gt;Cornell, Martin. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Other Burton brewers, including [[Bass Brewery|Bass]] and [[Salt's Brewery|Salt]], were anxious to replace their lost Russian export market and quickly followed Allsopp's lead. Likely as a result of the advantages of Burton water in brewing,&lt;ref&gt;The water of Burton on Trent contains a very high concentration of sulfate which accentuates the bitterness of beer. See Daniels, Foster, and Cornell.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton India Pale Ale was preferred by merchants and their customers in India.

Demand for the export style of pale ale, which had become known as &quot;India Pale Ale,&quot; developed in England around 1840 and India Pale Ale became a popular product in England.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, p. 155&lt;br&gt;Cornell, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Some brewers dropped the term &quot;India&quot; in the late 19th century, but records indicated that these &quot;pale ales&quot; retained the features of earlier IPA.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; American, Australian, and Canadian brewers manufactured beer with the label IPA before 1900, and records suggest that these beers were similar to English IPA of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels p. 157-58&lt;br&gt;Cornell, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodgson's October beer style clearly influenced the Burton Brewers's India Pale Ale. His beer was only slightly higher in alcohol than most beer brewed in his day and would not have been considered a strong ale; however, a greater proportion of the [[wort]] was well-fermented, leaving behind few residual sugars, and the beer was strongly hopped.&lt;ref&gt;Foster  p. 17-21 discusses the hopping rate; Daniels p. 154 discusses the high level of fermentation.&lt;/ref&gt; The common story that early IPAs were much stronger than other beers of the time, however, is a myth.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[porter (beer)|porter]] shipped to India at the same time survived the voyage, and common claims that Hodgson formulated his beer to survive the trip and that other beers would not survive the trip are probably false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zythophile.wordpress.com/false-ale-quotes/myth-4-george-hodgson-invented-ipa-to-survive-the-long-trip-to-india/ Myth 4: George Hodgson invented IPA to survive the long trip to India]&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that by the 1860s, India Pale Ales were widely brewed in England and that they were much more [[Attenuation (brewing)|attenuated]] and highly hopped than porters and many other ales.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
The term IPA is common in the United Kingdom for low-gravity beers, for example ''[[Greene King]] IPA'' and ''[[Charles Wells Ltd|Charles Wells]] Eagle IPA''. IPAs with an [[abv]] of 4% or lower have been brewed in Britain since at least the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Whitbread and Barclay Perkins|title=Brewing records|location=London Metropolitan Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
IPA has a long history in the USA with many breweries producing a version of the style.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; American IPAs are brewed with a single hop variety or a blend of varieties including [[Cascade hop|Cascade]], Centennial, Columbus, [[Chinook hops|Chinook]], Simcoe, [[Amarillo hops|Amarillo]], Tomahawk, Warrior, and Nugget. This is in contrast to the [[Fuggles]], Golding and Bullion hops of British styles. 

IPA type beers brewed in the United States include [[Boulevard Brewing Company|Boulevard]] Single Wide IPA, [[Brooklyn Brewery|Brooklyn]] East India IPA, [[Dogfish Head Brewery|Dogfish Head]] 60 Minute IPA, [[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company|Sierra Nevada]] Torpedo,  [[Lagunitas Brewing Company|Lagunitas]] IPA, [[Breckenridge Brewery &amp; Pub|Breckenridge]] Lucky U IPA, [[New Belgium Brewing Company|New Belgium]] Range  IPA, [[Marble Brewery]] IPA ([[Albuquerque]]), [[Goose Island Brewery|Goose Island]] IPA, and [[Abita Brewing Company]] Jockamo IPA.

Double India Pale Ales are a strong, very hoppy variant of IPAs that typically have alcohol content above 7.5% by volume.&lt;ref&gt;http://beeradvocate.com/articles/599 Beer Advocate, ''American Double IPA''&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is thought to have started near [[San Diego, California]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/rowe/20060308-9999-lz1f08rowe.html SignOnSanDiego.com &gt; News &gt; Metro &gt; Peter Rowe - Some believe bitter brew should be renamed to reflect San Diego roots&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American lager''' or '''North American lager''' is [[pale lager]] which is made and consumed in North America. Pale lager originated in Europe in the mid-19th century, and moved to America with German immigrants. As a general trend outside of [[Bavaria]] and the [[Czech Republic]] where the beers may be firmly hopped, pale lager developed as a modestly hopped beer, and sometimes used [[adjuncts]] such as rice or maize - and this was also true in America.

Worldwide, the best-known American lager is likely [[Anheuser-Busch]]'s [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], though prominent brands are also made by [[MillerCoors]] (South Africa/United States/United Kingdom). Pale lager is the predominant choice among America's largest brewing companies, however it is  usually not found in [[microbreweries]] throughout the USA.

This beer style is defined by inclusion in categories like &quot;American-Style Light Lager&quot;, &quot;American-Style Low-Carbohydrate Light Lager&quot;, &quot;American-Style Lager&quot;, and &quot;American-Style Premium Lager&quot; at the [[World Beer Cup]] or &quot;North American Style Lager&quot;, &quot;North American Style Premium Lager&quot; at the [[Canadian Beer Awards]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}

[[Pale lager]] was introduced to the United States in the 19th century by German immigrants. These German brewers developed their beers from the American six-row [[barley]] which has a higher [[tannic acid]] and protein content and had greater husk per weight than the continental European barleys. In addition, the Tettnanger and [[Saaz hops]] of Europe were not available. Therefore, the grain mixture was adjusted by adding up to 30% [[maize|corn]] to the barley malt mash. However, the beer was brewed to full-fledged European strength and to the practices of a [[pale lager]] style. After [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], when beer production resumed, brewers used up to 50% corn or [[rice]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Currently, the only large-scale representative of the pre-Prohibition lager style in the United States is [[D.G. Yuengling &amp; Son]] with its Traditional Lager, [[Genesee Brewing Company]] with its Genesee Beer and [[August Schell Brewing Company]] with its Original.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In recent years a number of smaller American breweries have also reintroduced it, such as [[Victory Brewing Company]] and Scrimshaw Pilsner [[North Coast Brewing Company]] from northern California. (Throwback Lager) and [[Full Sail Brewing Company]] (Session Lager).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Rice gained popularity in the domestic brewing market during World War II due to grain rationing on the home-front.  Most breweries were unable to afford the necessary amounts of barley required for production and so began using rice as a filler.  This also had the added benefit of lightening the flavor of beer, making it more appealing to the new female workforce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  After the war, the process was not changed.

Some &quot;premium&quot; beers made in this style use only barley malt, with no corn or rice at all, though they are considered more or less the same style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

'''Bière de Garde''' (&quot;beer for keeping&quot;) is a [[strong pale ale]] or [[keeping beer]] traditionally brewed in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000053.html Beerhunter: ''Ale and Hearty'']&lt;/ref&gt; These beers were originally brewed in farmhouses during the winter and spring, to avoid unpredictable problems with the yeast during the summertime. Farmhouse production is now supplemented by commercial production, although most Bière de Garde brewers are small businesses.

Typically, beers of this tradition are of a copper colour or golden colour, and as the name suggests the origins of this style lies in the tradition that it was matured/cellared for a period of time once bottled (and most sealed with a cork), to be consumed later in the year, akin to a Belgian [[Saison (ale)|Saison]].
Most varieties are [[top-fermented]] and unfiltered, although bottom-fermented and/or filtered versions exist. Particularly authentic products, using only regional ingredients, are entitled to use the ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'', &quot;Pas de Calais/Region du Nord''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Glover: ''The Complete Handbook of Beers and Brewing''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the better known brands include [[Brasserie de Saint-Sylvestre]], ''[[Trois Monts (Beer)|Trois Monts]]'' (8.5%[[Alcohol by volume|abv]]), Brasseurs Duyck, ''[[Jenlain (beer)|Jenlain]]'' (7.5%[[Alcohol by volume|abv]]), [[Brasserie Castelain]], ''Ch'Ti'' and Brasserie La Choulette,'' Ambrée'' (7.5%[[Alcohol by volume|abv]]).

'''Malt liquor''' is a [[North American]] term referring to a type of [[beer]] with high [[ethanol|alcohol]] content. In legal [[statutes]], the term often includes any alcoholic [[beverage]] above or equal to 5% [[alcohol by volume]] made with [[malted barley]]. In common parlance, however, it is used for high-alcohol beers made with ingredients and processes resembling those in [[American-style lager]]. However, this label is subject to the viewpoint of the [[brewer]], as there are indeed examples of brews containing high-quality, expensive ingredients that brewers have chosen to label as &quot;malt liquors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dogfish Head - Liquor de Malt&quot;&gt;[http://www.dogfish.com/brewings/Limited_Edition_Beers/Liquor_de_Malt/21/index.htm Dogfish Head - Liquor de Malt] Dogfish Head Brewery. Accessed on March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parts of [[Canada]], the term &quot;malt liquor&quot; ([[French language|French]]: ''liqueur de malt'') is rather used to refer to any [[malt beverage]]s in general (American equivalent being &quot;[[alcopop]]&quot;).

==Manufacture==
Malt liquor is a [[strong lager]] or [[ale]] in which [[sugar]], [[maize|corn]] or other [[adjuncts]] are added to the malted barley to boost the total amount of fermentable sugars in the [[wort]], and thus the final alcoholic strength produced. These beers tend to be mildly [[hops|hopped]] (that is, they are not very [[Taste#Bitterness|bitter]]).

==Brewing and legal definitions==
Malt liquor is typically straw to pale amber in color. While typical beer and malt liquor are both made primarily from [[barley]], water, and [[hops]], malt liquors tend to make much greater use of inexpensive adjuncts such as [[maize|corn]], [[rice]], or [[dextrose]]. Use of these adjuncts, along with the addition of special [[enzymes]], results in a higher percentage of alcohol than that which is typical for beer. Higher alcohol versions, sometimes called &quot;[[High gravity beer|High Gravity]]&quot; or just &quot;HG&quot;, may contain high levels of [[fusel alcohol]]s, which gives off solvent- or fuel-like aromas and flavors.&lt;ref name=&quot;forty-beeradvocate&quot;&gt;[http://beeradvocate.com/articles/288 Breaking Out the Forty]  Beer Advocate.com. March 21, 2001. Accessed on December 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;    

The apparently confusing and inconsistent use of the term 'malt liquor' has to do with the vagaries of American [[alcoholic beverage]] regulations, which can vary from [[U.S. states|state]] to state. In some states, &quot;malt liquor&quot; refers to any alcoholic beverage made by [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermenting]] [[grain]] and water; in these states a [[non-alcoholic beer]] may also be called a non-alcoholic or non-intoxicating malt liquor. In some states, products labeled 'beer' must fall below a certain alcohol content, and beers that exceed the mark must be labeled as 'malt liquor'. While ordinary beers in the United States average around 5% alcohol by volume, malt liquors typically range from 6% up to 9% alcohol by volume. A typical legal definition is [[Colorado]]'s Rev. Stat. ss. 12-47-103(19), which provides that:

:&quot;Malt Liquors&quot; includes beer and shall be construed to mean any beverage obtained by the alcoholic fermentation of any infusion or decoction of barley, malt, hops or any other similar products, or any combination thereof, in water containing more than three and two-tenths percent of alcohol by weight.
 
:&lt;small&gt;(Note: alcohol percentages measured by weight translate into larger figures when re-expressed as [[alcohol by volume|alcohol percentages by volume]], because ethanol is less dense than water.)&lt;/small&gt;

==History==
The term &quot;malt liquor&quot; is documented in England in 1690 as an alternative word for ale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=6KLQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA252|title=The People's Journal |page=252|author=John Saunders|publisher=People's Journal|year= 1847|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of the term in North America appears in a patent issued by the Canadian government on July 6, 1842, to one G. Riley for &quot;an improved method of brewing ale, beer, porter, and other maltliquors.&quot;

While [[Colt 45 (malt liquor)|Colt 45]], [[St. Ides]], [[Mickey's]], [[Steel Reserve]], [[King Cobra (malt liquor)|King Cobra]], and [[Olde English 800]] are most closely associated with malt liquors in the United States, the beverage itself is older than these products. [[Clix Malt Liquor|Clix]] is often credited as the first malt liquor made in the United States, granted a [[patent]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02442806&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D2,442,806.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F2,442,806%2526RS%3DPN%2F2,442,806&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page  Clix Patent Filing] United States Patent and Trademark Office. Accessed December 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first widely successful malt liquor brand in America was Country Club, which was produced in the early 1950s by the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, MO, and marketed toward middle-class [[White Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.me.com/kihm/Site/Malt_Liquor.html A Story without Heroes: The Cautionary Tale of Malt Liquor] A History of Malt Liquor. April 30, 2005. Accessed on April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Today, malt liquors are marketed to an entirely different demographic, resulting in a [[stereotyping]] of the typical consumer. According to a study by [[Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science]] in [[California]], malt liquor is the [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] of choice of the [[homeless]] and [[unemployed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jointogether.org/news/research/summaries/2005/malt-liquor-favored-by.html Malt Liquor Favored By Homeless, Unemployed Drinkers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1980s, many brands of malt liquor began to aggressively target this market and used popular actors (such as [[Billy Dee Williams]]) or [[rapper]]s in their advertisements; [[Ice Cube]], for instance, appeared in radio advertisements for [[St. Ides]]. Some rappers vigorously opposed this trend, feeling that malt liquor manufacturers were exploiting the [[African American]] community. For example, [[Chuck D]], of the group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], took a very strong anti-malt liquor stance and once sued St. Ides over an advertisement that sampled his voice without permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315630,00.html Chuck D: This One's Not For You], Entertainment Weekly, Sept. 27, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forties (40s)==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Privatestock.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A forty of [[Private Stock (malt liquor)|Private Stock]]]] --&gt;
In the American vernacular, a '''forty-ounce''' or simply '''forty''' is a [[glass]] [[bottle]] that holds 40 [[fluid ounce]]s (1.18 [[litre|liters]]) of malt liquor.&lt;ref name=&quot;forty-beeradvocate&quot;/&gt; Malt liquors are commonly sold in 40 oz bottles, as opposed to the standard twelve ounce (355 mL) bottle that contains a single serving of beer. {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}  American domestic &quot;malt liquors&quot; tend to be very inexpensive (generally less than $3 for a 40 oz. bottle), although this is not necessarily true for foreign imports that are also labeled &quot;malt liquor.&quot; {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Examples of malt liquors sold in forty ounce bottles include [[Olde English 800]], [[Colt 45 (malt liquor)|Colt 45]], [[Mickey's]], [[Camo (beer)|Camo]] 40, Black Fist, Country Club, Black Bull, Labatt Blue Dry 6.1/7.1/8.1/9.1/10.1, WildCat, Molson Dry 6.5/7.5/8.5/10.1, [[Private Stock (malt liquor)|Private Stock]], [[Big Bear (Malt Liquor)|Big Bear]], [[St. Ides]], [[Steel Reserve 211]], B40 Bull Max, [[King Cobra (malt liquor)|King Cobra]], Jeremiah Weed, and [[Hurricane High Gravity Lager|Hurricane]]. [[Dogfish Head Brewery]] has sporadically produced a high-end [[bottle-conditioned]] forty called &quot;Liquor de Malt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dogfish Head - Liquor de Malt&quot;/&gt; [[Ballantine (brewery)|Ballantine]] markets its ale in a forty ounce bottle as well.

At least for a brief period in the mid-1990s, some brands of malt liquor, including Olde English 800 and Mickey's, were available in even larger, 64-ounce glass bottles. Forty-ounce bottles are not permitted in some US states, such as [[Florida]], where the largest container that a malt beverage may be sold at retail is 32 US fluid ounces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=Ch0563/SEC06.HTM&amp;Title=-%3E2006-%3ECh0563-%3ESection%2006#0563.06  Florida Statutes, Title XXXIV, Chapter 563; see item (6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty ounce bottles of malt liquor are also the subject of drinking game &quot;Edward Forty Hands&quot;, which involves the player duct taping a &quot;forty&quot; to each hand. He is not allowed to remove the glasses until both are finished.

==International==
While American malt liquor brands are rarely, if ever, exported to Europe, similar inexpensive high-alcohol beers are available in many areas there; these include the &quot;super-strength [[lagers]]&quot; such as [[Tennents Super]] and [[Special Brew|Carlsberg Special Brew]] in the United Kingdom, and in France the &quot;bières fortes&quot; Amsterdam Navigator, Amsterdam Maximator and [[Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands)|Bavaria 8.6]]; [http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/arboga-102/12495/ Arboga 10.2%] of Sweden

There is a strong tradition of premium high-alcohol beers in Europe, including the [[Trappist beer]]s of Belgium and The Netherlands, the [[bock]] beers of Germany and Austria, and the [[barley wine]]s of the United Kingdom. Unlike American malt liquors and super-strength lagers, these are beers known for a full body, a complex aroma, and higher prices.

==In Popular Culture==
The [[Beastie Boys]] wrote a [[Brass Monkey (song)|track]] which pays tribute to the [[Brass Monkey (cocktail)|Brass Monkey]] mixed drink - a cocktail featuring [[Olde English 800]] and orange juice or [[SunnyD|Sunny Delight]].

Malt liquor was referenced in the 2001 movie ''[[Pootie Tang]]'', directed by [[Louis C.K.]]

Michael McTague, author of ''My Struggle: Coping with Alcoholism'', has described Malt Liquor as &quot;The worst thing to ever happen to me.&quot;

The television program ''Saturday Night Live'' featured a mock commercial for &quot;Coldcock Malt Liquor&quot; with Tim Meadows, the spokesman, being called &quot;one malt liquor picker.&quot;  An announcer delivers the tag line &quot;Coldcock. You never see it coming.&quot;

In the 2006 movie ''[[Talladega Nights]]'', fictitious [[NASCAR]] driver Ricky Bobby ([[Will Ferell]]) was sponsored by ''Laughing Clown Malt Liqour''.

The song &quot;40's Theme&quot; by Umphrey's McGee refers to Malt Liquor (40s).  An example (in shorten format):  http://www.archive.org/details/um2002-03-07.shnf

Hip hop artist ''[[King Tee]]'' featured many rhymes about malt liquor on his albums, his first album ''[[Act a Fool (album)|Act a Fool]]'' features a can of ''[[Olde English 800]]'' on the front cover, and he later did radio and TV spots for ''[[St Ides]]'' in the 1990s. His protege group ''[[Tha Alkaholiks]]'' also rhymed about Malt Liquor and 40's, and their debut album ''[[21 &amp; Over]]'' has the group looking into a liquor stores 40 cooler where MGD and OE800 40's are clearly visible, on the front cover.

Rapper ''[[Eazy-E]]'' also paid homage to malt liquor, especially his favorite brand; he dedicated an ode to OE800 titled &quot;8-ball&quot; off the ''[[N.W.A|NWA]]'' album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]''.

In the TV show Workaholics, character Adam DeMamp is seen with two forties duct-taped to his hands in opening sequence of &quot;Dry Guys.&quot;

&quot;St. Ide's Heaven,&quot; a song by [[Elliott Smith]] on his [[Elliott Smith (album)|self-titled album]], also references malt liquor, as well as [[amphetamine]] abuse.

Rapper ''[[Afroman]]'' claims that &quot;Colt 45 and two zigzags baby that's all we need&quot; in his single ''Colt 45''

Young |publisher=Springer|year= 1982|ISBN=0-8342-1684-1 |accessdate=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;pale ale&quot; was being applied around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], which resulted in a lighter colour than other beers popular at that time. Different brewing practices and [[hops|hop]] levels have resulted in a range of taste and strength within the pale ale family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/ipa.htm India Pale Ale], Roger Protz, beer-pages.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pale ale was a term used for beers made from [[malt]] dried with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Coke had been first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it wasn't until around 1703 that the term &quot;pale ale&quot; was first used. By 1784, advertisements were appearing in the [[Hickey's Bengal Gazette|''Calcutta Gazette'']] for &quot;light and excellent&quot; pale ale. By 1830, the expressions &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;pale ale&quot; were synonymous. Breweries would tend to designate beers as pale ale, though customers would commonly refer to the same beers as bitter. It is thought that customers used the term bitter to differentiate these pale ales from other less noticeably hopped beers such as [[porter (beer)|porter]] and [[Mild ale|mild]]. By the mid to late 20th century, while brewers were still labeling bottled beers as pale ale, they had begun identifying cask beers as bitter, except those from [[Burton on Trent]], which tend to be referred to as pale ales regardless of the method of dispatch.

Amber ale is a term used in Australia, France and North America for pale ales brewed with a proportion of [[Mash ingredient#Crystal malt|crystal malt]] to produce an amber colour generally ranging from light copper to light brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001393.html James Squire Amber Ale] - [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] 1 October 2001: &quot;The designation Amber Ale is to be taken seriously&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of crystal or other coloured malt is added to the basic pale ale base to produce a slightly darker colour, as in some Irish and British pale ales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craftbeer.com/pages/style-finder/american-ales American Ales]&lt;/ref&gt; In France the term &quot;ambrée&quot; is used to signify a beer, either cold or warm fermented, which is amber in colour; the beer, as in ''[[Pelforth]] Ambrée'' and ''Fischer Amber'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasseriefischer.com/brasserie-fischer.htm Brasseriefisher.com]&lt;/ref&gt; may be a [[Vienna lager]], or it may be a [[Bière de Garde]] as in ''Jenlain Ambrée''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/duyck-jenlain-ambree/4677/ |title=Duyck Jenlain Ambrée |work=ratebeer.com |year=2011 [last update] |quote=Jenlain Ambrée |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, American-variety [[hops]] are used in varying degrees of bitterness, although very few examples are particularly hoppy. In Australia the most popular Amber Ale is from Malt Shovel Brewery, branded James Squire in honour of Australia's first brewer, who first brewed beer in Sydney in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerbrewguru.com.au/beer_style/amber-ale/ Beerbrewguru.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Pale Ale===
American Pale Ale (APA), was developed around 1980.&lt;ref name=Mosher&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JAIqQHkjXC8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=American+Pale+Ale&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Pale%20Ale&amp;f=false |title=Tasting Beer |author=Randy Mosher |page=212 |year=2011 |publisher= |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brewery thought to be the first to successfully use significant quantities of American hops in the style of APA and use the name ''Pale Ale'', was the [[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-md8xL0EBgkC&amp;pg=PT120&amp;dq=sierra+nevada+pale+ale+history&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Brewing Up a Business |first= |author=Sam Calagione|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who brewed the first experimental batch of ''Sierra Nevada Pale Ale'' in November 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sierranevada.com/about/history.html |title=Sierra Nevada History  |work=sierranevada.com |year=2009 [last update] |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributing the finished version in March 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=2ka6SAkh1DQC |title=Ambitious Brew |author=Maureen Ogle|page=305|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year= 2006 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anchor Liberty Ale'', a 6% abv ale originally brewed by [[Anchor Brewing Company]] as a special in 1975 to commemorate [[Paul Revere]]'s midnight ride in 1775 which marked the start of the [[American War of Independence]], was seen by [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] as the first modern American ale.&lt;ref name=Liberty&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NuFJAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Anchor+Liberty+Ale+history&amp;q=Anchor+Liberty+Ale#search_anchor |title=Michael Jackson's beer companion |author=Michael Jackson |pages=161–162 |publisher=Running Press |year= 1997 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fritz Maytag]], the owner of Anchor, visited British breweries in London, Yorkshire and [[Burton upon Trent brewing|Burton upon Trent]], picking up information about robust pale ales, which he used when he made his American version using just malt rather than the malt and sugar combination common in brewing at that time, and making prominent use of the American hop, [[Cascade hops|Cascade]].&lt;ref name=Liberty/&gt; The beer was popular, and became a regular in 1983.&lt;ref name=Liberty/&gt; Other pioneers of a hoppy American pale ale were Jack McAuliffe of the [[New Albion Brewing Company]] and Bert Grant of [[Yakima Brewing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.craftbeer.com/pages/stories/featured-brewery/show?title=new-albion-brewing |title=CraftBeer.com &amp;#124; Featured Brewery: New Albion Brewing |author=John Holl |work=craftbeer.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001575.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - How Bert Grant Saved The World |author=Michael Jackson |work=beerhunter.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bière de Garde===
{{Main|Bière de Garde}}
[[Image:3Monts-Btl-and-Gls.jpg|thumb|100px|A [[Bière de Garde]]]]
Bière de Garde, or &quot;keeping beer&quot;, is a pale ale traditionally brewed in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region of [[France]].  These beers were usually brewed by farmhouses in the winter and spring, to avoid unpredictable problems with the yeast during the summertime.

The origins of the name lies in the tradition that it was matured/cellared for a period of time once bottled (and most sealed with a cork), to be consumed later in the year, akin to a [[Saison (ale)|Saison]].

There are a number of beers named Bière de Garde in [[France]], but some of the better known brands include:[[Brasserie de Saint-Sylvestre]], ''Trois Monts'' (8.5%[[Alcohol by volume|abv]]); Brasseurs Duyck, ''[[Jenlain (beer)|Jenlain]]'' (6.5%abv); and Brasserie La Choulette, ''Ambrée'' (7.5%abv).

===Blonde===
Blonde ales are very pale in colour. The term &quot;Blonde&quot; for pale beers is popular in Europe - particularly in France, Belgium and the UK, though the beers may not have much in common, other than colour. Blondes tend to be clear, crisp, and dry, with low-to-medium bitterness and aroma from [[hops]], and some sweetness from [[malt]].  Fruitiness from [[ester]]s may be perceived.  A lighter body from higher [[carbonation]] may be noticed. In the United Kingdom, golden or summer ales were developed in the late 20th century by breweries to compete with the [[pale lager]] market. A typical golden ale has an appearance and profile similar to that of a pale lager. Malt character is subdued and the hop profile ranges from spicy to citrus; common hops include Styrian Golding and Cascade. Alcohol is in the 4% to 5% abv range. The UK style is attributed to John Gilbert, owner of [[Hop Back Brewery]], who developed &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; in 1989, which then won several awards and inspired numerous imitators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desdemoor.co.uk/hop-back-summer-lightning/ |title=Hop Back Summer Lightning « Beer Culture with Des de Moor |publisher=desdemoor.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgian_beer#Blonde_or_golden_ale|Belgian blondes]] are often made with [[pilsner malt]].&lt;ref name=webb81&gt;Tim Webb. ''Good Beer Guide to Belgium'', 6th edition, p 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some beer writers regard blonde and golden ales as distinct styles, while others do not. [[Duvel]] is a typical Belgian blonde ale, and one of the most popular bottled beers in the country&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Handbook of Beers and Brewing'' Brian Glover&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being well-known internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303499204576389473593410488.html [[Wall Street Journal]]. ''Belgian Brewer Finds Crafty Success'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burton Pale Ale===
Later in the second half of the nineteenth century, the recipe for pale ale was put into use by the [[Burton upon Trent]] brewers, notably [[Bass brewery|Bass]]; ales from Burton were considered of a particularly high quality due to synergy between the malt and hops in use and local water chemistry, especially the presence of [[gypsum]]. Burton retained absolute dominance in pale ale brewing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZcoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=pale+ale+definition&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=pale%20ale%20definition&amp;f=false |title=The dictionary of trade products ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until a chemist, C. W. Vincent discovered the process of [[Burtonisation]] to reproduce the chemical composition of the water from Burton-upon-Trent, thus giving any brewery the capability to brew pale ale.

===English Bitter===
{{Main|Bitter (beer)}}
The expression first appeared in the early 19th century as part of the development and spread of Pale Ale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Breweries would tend to designate beers as &quot;pale ale&quot;, though customers would commonly refer to the same beers as &quot;bitter&quot;. It is thought that customers used the term bitter to differentiate these pale ales from other less noticeably hopped beers such as [[Porter (beer)|porter]] and [[Mild ale|mild]].  Drinkers tend to loosely group modern bitter into &quot;session&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; bitter (up to 4.1% abv), &quot;best&quot; or &quot;regular&quot; bitter (between 4.2% and 4.7% abv) and &quot;special&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; bitter (4.8% abv and over).

Golden or summer ales have an appearance and profile similar to that of a [[pale lager]]. [[Hop Back Brewery]] brewed one of the first, called &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;, in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desdemoor.co.uk/hop-back-summer-lightning/ |title=Hop Back Summer Lightning &quot; Beer Culture with Des de Moor |publisher=desdemoor.co.uk |accessdate=2010-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India Pale Ale was a British October pale ale or [[keeping beer]] bought for export to India. ''[[Worthington White Shield]]'', originating in Burton-upon-Trent, is a beer considered to be part of the development of India Pale Ale.

===Irish Red ale===
Irish red ale, red ale, or Irish ale is a name used by brewers in [[Irish beer|Ireland]]; ''[[Smithwick's]]'' is a typical Irish red ale.

There is some dispute as to whether Irish Red Ale is a genuine style or the same as English keg Bitter.&lt;ref name=Beoir&gt;{{Cite web  | title = The Irish Red Paradox  | publisher = Beoir   | year = 2011  | url = http://www.beoir.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=175:the-irish-red-paradox&amp;catid=33:beoir-meets&amp;Itemid=95  | accessdate = 2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the name can describe a darker amber ale or a &quot;red&quot; beer that is a [[lager]] with caramel colouring.


Smithwick's has introduced a Pale Ale craft brewed product advertised as 100% pale ale malt and aromatic hops with a 4.5% alcoholic content. The product is sold in 500ml bottles

===India Pale Ale (IPA)===
{{main|India Pale Ale}}
India Pale Ale or IPA is a style of pale ale developed in England for export to India. The first known use of the expression &quot;India pale ale&quot; is in an advertisement in the ''Liverpool Mercury'' of January 30, 1835.

==Strong pale ale==
Strong pale ales are ales made predominantly with pale malts and have an alcohol strength that may start around 5%, though typically starts a bit higher at 7 or 8% by volume and may go up to 12%, though brewers have been pushing the alcohol strength higher. In 1994 the [[Hair of the Dog Brewing Company]] produced a Strong Pale Ale with an abv of 29%. Brewdog recently released &quot;Sink the Bismark&quot;, a 41% alcohol volume pale ale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/hair-of-the-dog-dave/23897/ Hair of the Dog Dave from Hair of the Dog Brewing Company, a Barley Wine style beer: An unofficial page for Hair of the Dog Dave from Hair of the Dog Brewing Company in Portland, Oregon , United States of America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Orval Brewery|Orval]]'' typifies the Belgian pale ale style, and is fermented with some [[Brettanomyces]] in addition to [[Saccharomyces]] yeast.

===American Strong Ale===
American strong ale is a broad category used in America to describe [[ale]]s of 7.0% abv or higher.  Beers in this category may also be classified as double India Pale Ales, [[barley wine]]s, or [[old ale]] depending on the style.

===Strong Ale===
Strong Ale is the name given to strong pale ale brewed in England above the strength of 5% abv.&lt;ref&gt;

===Scotch ale===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:McEwansScotchAle-3182e.jpg|thumb|right|100px|McEwan's Scotch&amp;nbsp;Ale]] --&gt;
Scotch Ale was first used as a designation for strong ales exported from [[Edinburgh]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Younger Centuries, by David Keir, 1951, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; The term has become popular in the USA, where strong ales which may be available in Scotland under a different name are sold in America as &quot;Scotch Ale&quot;, for example, [[Caledonian Brewery|Caledonian's]] ''Edinburgh Strong Ale'' or ''Edinburgh Tattoo'', is sold in the USA as ''Edinburgh Scotch Ale''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/caledonian-edinburgh-tattoo-strong-ale/2812/ Caledonian Edinburgh Scotch Ale from Caledonian (S&amp;N, Heineken), an English Strong Ale style beer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As with other examples of strong ales, such as [[Barley wine]], these beers tend toward sweetness and a full body. Examples from the Caledonian brewery would have toffee notes from the caramelizing of the malt from the direct fired copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Good Beer Book  |page=151 |author= Timothy Harper, Garrett Oliver|publisher=Berkley Books|date=Mar 1, 1997 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caramelizing of Caledonian's beers is popular in America and has led many American brewers to produce strong toffee sweet beers which they label as a Scotch Ale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scotch Ale   |first= Gregory J. |last=Noonan|page=92|publisher=Brewers Publications |date= Jan 25, 1993|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotch Ale or Whiskey Ale is a designation used by brewers in France and Belgium for peat-smoked malt flavoured beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2005/Art/0505/featu2.php The Prague Post Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the malt used by distillers in Scotland is no longer dried by peat burning, some peat smoke flavour is added during malting by an additional process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://books.google.fr/books?id=9P3lGgNahvgC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Whisky: technology, production and marketing |first=Inge  |last=Russell|page=63 |publisher=Academic Press |date= 2003 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although recent research from brewing historian Ron Pattinson shows a lack of evidence for peat smoked malt being used by any Scottish breweries, American craft brewers often add peat smoked malt in their versions of Scotch ale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2011/09/peat-in-scottish-brewing.html Peat in Scottish Brewing by Ron Pattinson]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://barclayperkins.blogspot.com/2011/10/peat-in-scottish-malting.html Peat in Scottish malting by Ron Pattinson]&lt;/ref&gt;  These malts are occasionally used in beers where the peat smoke flavour is reminiscent of whisky. The most popular French example is Fischer's Adelscott.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jackson's Beer Companion, Michael Jackson, page 236, Running Press, Jun 19, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  The brewer Douglas Ross of the Bridge of Allan brewery made the first Scottish example of a Whiskey Ale for the Tullibardine Distillery in 2006;&lt;ref&gt;

Scotch Ale is sometimes conflated with the term &quot;Wee Heavy&quot;, as both are used to describe a strong beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FhF2uV6blXAC&amp;pg=PT2327&amp;dq=%22wee+heavy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WaBHT9i5GYaf8gPnzKixDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wee%20heavy%22&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer  |first=Alaistair  |last=Gilmour |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2011  |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of beers brewed in the USA under the name Wee Heavy tend to be 7% abv and higher, while Scottish-brewed examples, such as [[Belhaven Brewery|Belhaven]]'s ''Wee Heavy'', can be found between 5.5% and 6.5% abv.

[[Image:Industrial-barrels.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Industrial barrels of lambic]]

'''Lambic''' is a very distinctive type of [[beer]] brewed traditionally in the [[Pajottenland]] region of [[Belgium]] (southwest of [[Brussels]]) and in Brussels itself at the [[Cantillon Brewery]] and museum. Lambic is now mainly consumed after refermentation, resulting in derived beers such as [[Gueuze]] or [[Kriek lambic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1991&quot;&gt;Jackson, Michael (1991). Michael Jackson's Great Beers of Belgium&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike conventional [[ale]]s and [[lager]]s, which are [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermented]] by carefully cultivated strains of brewer's [[yeast]]s, lambic beer is produced by spontaneous fermentation: it is exposed to the wild yeasts and bacteria that are said to be native to the [[Senne]] valley, in which Brussels lies. It is this unusual process which gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, [[wiktionary:vinous|vinous]], and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.

== Brewing ==
[[Image:Crushed hop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aged dried hops]]
[[Image:Coolingtun.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Reefer ship|Coolship]]&lt;!-- What does &quot;Coolship&quot; mean? Is it a type of ship? It isn't discussed anywhere in the article. --&gt;, where the wort is inoculated with wild yeast spores via the open slats in the wall]]

Today the beer is generally brewed from a [[grist]] containing approximately 70% [[barley]] [[malt]] and 30% unmalted [[wheat]]. When the [[wort (brewing)|wort]] has cooled, it is left exposed to the open air so that fermentation may occur spontaneously. While this exposure is a critical feature of the style, many of the key yeasts and bacteria are now understood to reside within the brewery and its (usually timber) fermenting vessels in numbers far greater than any delivered by the breeze. Up to 86 microorganisms have been identified in lambic beer, the most significant being ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Brettanomyces lambicus|B. lambicus]]''. The process is generally only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kriek - Lindemans |url=http://www.lindemans.be/start/lambik/en |title=The birth of Lambic |publisher=lindemans.be |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least the 11th century and probably earlier, [[hops]] have been used in beer for their natural [[preservative]] qualities as well as for the pleasant bitterness, flavor, and aroma they impart. Today it is the latter that is the reason for their inclusion in almost all beer styles other than lambic. Since the method of inoculation and long fermentation time of lambic beers increases the risk of [[spoilage]], lambic brewers still use large amounts of hops for their antibacterial properties. To avoid making the beer extremely bitter, however, aged, dry hops (which have lost much of their bitterness) are used. Consequently, lambics often have a strong, cheese-like, &quot;old hop&quot; aroma, in contrast to the resiny, herbal, earthy hop bitterness found in other styles.

After the fermentation process starts, the lambic is siphoned into old port or sherry barrels (of chestnut or oak) from Portugal or Spain (some of the brewers prefer used wine barrels.) The lambic is left to ferment and mature for one to two or even three years. It forms a [[flor|&quot;velo de flor&quot;]] of yeast that gives some protection from oxidation, in a similar way to [[vin jaune]] and [[sherry]]; the barrels are not topped up.

Another important feature of lambic is that it is usually a blend of at least two different beers; many &quot;producers&quot; are in fact blenders who buy beers from other brewers, and blend two or more together to create the desired result. A good [[gueuze]], for example, may have occupied space in several different cellars over 6 years or more. The locals are justifiably proud of their unique beer, and recent years have seen an explosion of interest around the world for this unusual beverage despite — or perhaps because of — its complex process of production. While those outside of the area are most likely to find the bottled gueuze and fruit versions, there are a wide variety of styles available to the local drinker, and they are often blended again or sweetened with sugar or flavored [[syrups]] before drinking, as some examples can be extremely tart.

Lambic beer is widely consumed in Brussels and environs, and frequently featured as an ingredient in [[Belgian cuisine]].

== Types of lambic and derived beers ==

Most, if not all varieties listed below have [[Protected designation of origin|Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG)]] status.

=== Lambic (pure) ===

Unblended lambic is a cloudy, uncarbonated, bracingly sour beverage available on tap in only a few locations. Generally three years old. Bottled offerings from [[Cantillon Brewery|Cantillon]] and De Cam can be found outside of Belgium.

=== Gueuze ===
{{main|Gueuze}}

A mixture of young (one-year-old) and old (two- and three-year-old) lambics that have been bottled. It undergoes secondary fermentation, producing carbon dioxide, because the young lambics are not yet fully fermented. It keeps in the bottle; a good gueuze will be given a year to referment in the bottle, but can be kept for 10–20 years. An obscure German top-fermenting style, [[Gose]], is not to be confused with gueuze.

=== Mars ===

Mars traditionally referred to a weaker beer made from the second runnings of a lambic brewing.  It is no longer commercially produced. In the 1990s, the [[Boon Brewery|Boon brewery]] made a modern Mars beer called ''Lembeek's 2%'' (the 2% referring to the alcohol content), but its production has since been discontinued.

=== Faro ===

Historically, a low-alcohol, sweetened beer made from a blend of lambic and a much lighter, freshly brewed beer (called ''meertsbier'', not necessarily a lambic) to which [[brown sugar]] (or sometimes [[caramel]] or [[molasses]]) was added.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jackson's beer companion, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes herbs were added as well. The use of the lighter beer (or even water) and of substandard lambic in the blend made this a cheap, light, sweet beer for everyday use. The 19th century French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] commented on Faro's (to him) disagreeable aftertaste, &quot;It's beer that you drink twice&quot;, believing that the Faro in [[Brussels]] was brewed from the waters of a river (the [[Senne]] or [[Zenne]]) that was also used as a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p8i33BpBn0oC&amp;pg=PA382&amp;lpg=PA382&amp;dq=Charles+Baudelaire+faro|title=The Flowers of Evil |page=382 |author=Charles Baudelaire |work=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |ISBN= 0-19-283545-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugar was originally added shortly before serving, and therefore did not add carbonation or alcohol to the beverage (because the sugar did not have the time to ferment). Modern faro beer is still characterized by the use of brown sugar and lambic, but is not necessarily a light beer. The use of meertsbier has disappeared, and modern faro is not viewed as cheap or light. Modern faro is bottled, sweetened and pasteurized to prevent refermentation in the bottle. Examples are produced by [[Cantillon Brewery|Cantillon]], [[Boon Brewery|Boon]], [[Lindemans Brewery|Lindemans]] or [[Mort Subite]].

=== Kriek ===

Lambic refermented in the presence of [[sour cherry|sour cherries (morello cherry)]] and with secondary fermentation in the bottle results in [[Kriek lambic|kriek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1991&quot;/&gt; Traditional versions of kriek are dry and sour, just as traditional [[Gueuze]].

=== Fruit ===

Lambic with the addition of [[raspberry]] ([[framboise]]), [[peach]] (pêche), [[blackcurrant]] (cassis), [[grape]] (druif), or [[strawberry]] (aardbei), as either whole fruit or syrup. Other, rarer fruit lambic flavorings include [[apple]] (pomme), [[banana]] (banane), [[pineapple]] (ananas), [[apricot]] (abricotier), [[plum]] (prunier), [[cloudberry]] (plaquebière), [[lemon]] (citron), and [[blueberry]] (bleuet). Fruit lambics are usually bottled with secondary fermentation.  Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, cassis, etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from lambic.  The fruit beers produced by the Liefmans brewery, for example, actually use a [[oud bruin|brown ale (Oud Bruin)]], rather than a lambic as a base. Many of the non-traditional fruit beers derived from lambic that were commercialized in the last decades are considered to be low quality products by many beer enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1991&quot;/&gt; These products are typically artificially sweetened and based on syrups instead of fresh fruit, resulting in a taste experience that is quite remote from the traditional products.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;''lambic''&quot; entered English via [[French language|French]], but comes from the [[Dutch language]]. Lambic is probably derived from the name &quot;Lembeek&quot;, referring to the municipality of [[Lembeek]] near [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], close to [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1991&quot;/&gt;

== Use in popular culture ==

* Lambik is the name given by [[Willy Vandersteen]] to a Belgian character in the comic strip [[Spike and Suzy]] (Suske en Wiske in Dutch) which appeared in [[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">[[Image:Pale Ale.jpg|right|thumb|A glass of bitter]]

'''Bitter''' is an [[Beer in England|English]] term for [[pale ale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ron Pattinson, ''Beer, ale and malt liquor: old British beer terminology'' (2004) http://www.xs4all.nl/~patto1ro/beerale.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  Bitters vary in colour from [[Golden ale (UK)|gold]] to dark amber and in strength from 3% to 7% [[alcohol by volume]].

==Brief history==
''Pale ale'' was a term used for beers made from [[malt]] dried with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Coke had been first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it wasn't until around 1703 that the term ''pale ale'' was first used. By 1784, advertisements were appearing in the [[Hickey's Bengal Gazette|''Calcutta Gazette'']] for &quot;light and excellent&quot; pale ale. By 1830, the expressions ''bitter'' and ''pale ale'' were synonymous in England&lt;ref&gt;''The long battle between ale and beer'' (December 2009) http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/the-long-battle-between-ale-and-beer/&lt;/ref&gt; where breweries would tend to designate beers as ''pale ale'', though customers in the pub would commonly refer to the same beers as ''bitter''. It is thought that customers used the term ''bitter'' to differentiate these pale ales from other less noticeably [[Hops|hopped]] beers such as [[porter (beer)|porter]] and [[Mild ale|mild]]. By the mid to late 20th century, while brewers were still labelling bottled beers as pale ale, they had begun identifying cask beers as bitter, except those from [[Burton on Trent]], which tend to be referred to as pale ales regardless of the method of dispatch.

==Style==
Bitter belongs to the ''pale ale'' [[beer style|style]] and can have a great variety of strength, flavour and appearance from dark amber to a golden summer ale. It can go under 3% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] - known as ''Boys Bitter'' - and as high as 7% with ''premium'' or ''strong'' bitters. The colour may be controlled by the addition of [[caramel color|caramel colour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-types of bitter==
[[File:Ale_Bitter.jpg|thumb|left|A pint of bitter]]
British brewers have several loose names for variations in beer strength, such as ''best bitter'', ''special bitter'', ''extra special bitter'', and ''premium bitter''. There is no agreed and defined difference between an ''ordinary'' and a ''best bitter'' other than one particular brewery's ''best bitter'' will usually be stronger than its ''ordinary''. Two groups of drinkers may mark differently the point at which a ''best bitter'' then becomes a ''premium bitter''. Hop levels will vary within each sub group, though there is a tendency for the hops in the ''session bitter'' group to be more noticeable.

Drinkers tend to loosely group the beers into:

===Session or ordinary bitter===
Strength up to 4.1% abv. The majority of British beers with the name [[India Pale Ale|''IPA'']] will be found in this group, such as Greene King IPA, Deuchars IPA, Flowers IPA, Wadworth Henrys Original IPA, etc. Though bearing the name IPA, these session bitters are not as strong and hoppy as an [[India Pale Ale]] would be in the USA and elsewhere. IPAs with modest [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|gravities]] (below 1040º) have been brewed in Britain since at least the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Whitbread and Barclay Perkins|title=Brewing records|location=London Metropolitan Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most common strength of bitter sold in British pubs. It accounts for 16.9% of pub sales.&lt;ref name=StatsBook&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statistical Handbook|date=2003|publisher=British Beer and Pub Association|issn=1475-3545|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Best or regular bitter===
Strength between 4.2% and 4.7% abv. In the United Kingdom bitter above 4.2% abv accounts for just 2.9% of pub sales.&lt;ref name=StatsBook/&gt; The disappearance of weaker bitters from some brewers' rosters means &quot;best&quot; bitter is actually the weakest in the range.

===Premium or strong bitter===
Strength of 4.8% abv and over. Also known as ''Extra Special Bitter'', or in Canada and the USA, ''ESB'' (ESB is a brand name in the UK).

==Light ale==
'''Light ale''' is a crisply carbonated, low hopped, low abv bottled bitter that is mainly used as a mix with another beer, but is sometimes used as a low alcohol beer. 

==Bitter outside England==
The term ''pale ale'' is used in Scotland though ''ESB'' (for &quot;Extra Special Bitter&quot;) is more commonly used  in the United States. Where ''bitter'' is used it indicates a pale ale of lower alcohol content brewed in a less hop-focused style than typical American pale ales.  American bitters often use English varieties of hops.

[[Victoria Bitter]] is the best selling beer in Australia but despite its name, it is a standard lager.

'''Steinbier''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtaɪnˌbiːɐ|pron}}, [[German language|German]] for ''stone beer'') is a type of [[beer]] that was predominant in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] until the beginning of the 20th century. It was also commonin [[Scandinavia]], [[Franconia]] and south-western [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schleppe.at/content/sl/unternehmen/chronik/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbier is not mashed in [[kettle]]s, but in wooden tubs. Its name is derived from the hot stones that were put into the mashing tubs to achieve the required temperature for production. Due to the contact of the glowing, hot stones&amp;mdash;often heated directly in the fire&amp;mdash;with the malt, the resulting beer has a taste of [[caramel]] and [[soot]]. This was a traditional brewing process; [[top-fermenting]] [[yeast]]s and a fruity taste of [[ester]] were usual and there was no emphasis on long term storability. Steinbier was usually not filtered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brauen.de/braulexikon/biermarken-sorten/steinbier/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pilsner Urquell 2.JPG|thumb|A bottle and a glass of [[Pilsner Urquell]] beer]]
'''Pilsner''' (also '''pilsener''' or simply '''pils''') is a type of [[pale lager]]. It takes its name from the then city of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] (Plzeň), [[Bohemia]], in today's [[Czech Republic]], where a [[bottom-fermenting|bottom-fermented]] beer was first produced in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Michael|title=Prague: twinned with Burton-upon-Trent|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000054.html|work=The Beer Hunter|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original [[Pilsner Urquell]] [[beer]] is produced there today.

==Origin==
Until the mid-1840s, most Bohemian beers were top-[[Brewing#Fermenting|fermented]]. The taste and standards of quality often varied widely, and in 1838, consumers dumped whole barrels to show their dissatisfaction. The officials of Pilsen founded a city-owned brewery in 1839, called {{lang|de|''Bürger Brauerei''}} (Citizens' Brewery - now [[Plzeňský Prazdroj]]), brewing beer according to the pioneering [[Bavaria]]n style of brewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prazdroj.cz/en/about-the-company/history |title=Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. |publisher=www.prazdroj.cz |accessdate=17 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bavarian brewers had begun aging beer made with bottom-fermenting [[yeast]]s in caves (i.e.{{lang-de|''gelagert''}}), which improved the beer's clarity and [[shelf-life]]. Part of this research benefited from the knowledge already expounded on in a book (printed in German in 1794, in Czech in 1801), written by František Ondřej Poupě (''Ger'': Franz Andreas Paupie) (1753–1805) from [[Brno]].&lt;ref&gt;Basařová G.: Der legendäre böhmische Brauer František Ondřej Poupě (Franz Andreas Paupie) 1753-1805. Jahrbuch 2003 Gesellschaft für die Geschichte und Bibliographie des Brauwesens E.V. (GGB), (2003) 1, 128-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s.|''Bürger Brauerei'']] recruited the Bavarian brewer [[Josef Groll]] (1813–1887) who, using new techniques and paler [[malt]]s, presented his first batch of modern pilsner on 5 October 1842. The combination of pale colour from the new malts, Pilsen's remarkably soft water, [[Saaz hops|Saaz]] [[noble hops]] from nearby [[Žatec]] (''Saaz'' in German) and Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer that was regarded as a sensation.

Improving transport and communications also meant that this new beer was soon available throughout [[Central Europe]], and the {{lang|de|''Pilsner Brauart''}} style of brewing was soon widely imitated. In 1859, “Pilsner Bier” was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Pilsen. In 1898, the [[Pilsner Urquell]] trade mark was created to put emphasis on being the original brewery.
[[File:Tuzlanski pilsner.jpg|thumb|upright|Bottle of Tuzlanski pilsner [[Pivara Tuzla]]]]

==Modern pilsners==

The introduction to Germany of modern refrigeration by [[Carl von Linde]] in the late 19th century eliminated the need for caves for beer storage, enabling the brewing of bottom-fermenting beer in many new locations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Altbier im Alltag&quot; by Genno Fonk, 1999, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently the [[Pilsner Urquell]] brewery fermented its beer using open [[barrel]]s in the [[Wine cellar|cellar]]s beneath their brewery. This  changed in 1993 with the use of large cylindrical tanks. Small samples are still brewed in a traditional way for taste comparisons. 

A modern pilsner has a very light, clear colour from pale to golden yellow, and a distinct hop aroma and flavour. Czech pilsners tend toward a lighter flavour (good examples being [[Pilsner Urquell]] and [[Staropramen]]), while those in a German style can be more bitter (particularly in the north, e.g. [[Jever (beer)|Jever]]) or even &quot;earthy&quot; in flavour. Distinctive examples of German pilsners are&lt;!--ALPHABETIZED--&gt; Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren Jubiläums Pils, [[Augustiner Bräu|Augustiner]] Pils, [[Beck's]], [[Bitburger]], [[Flensburger Brauerei|Flensburger]] Pilsner, [[Fürstenberg Brewery|Fürstenberg]], [[Henninger Brewery|Henninger]]'s Kaiser Pilsner, [[Holsten]], [[König Brauerei|König]] Pilsner, [[Königsbacher]] Pilsner, [[Krombacher]], [[Kulmbacher Brewery|Kulmbacher]], [[Radeberger]], Schwelm's Schwelmer Pils, [[Veltins]], [[Warsteiner]], [[Würzburger Hofbräu]], and [[Wernesgrüner]]. On the other hand, Dutch ([[Amstel Brewery|Amstel]], [[Grolsch Brewery|Grolsch]], [[Heineken]]) and Belgian pilsners ([[Jupiler]], [[Stella Artois]]) have a slightly sweet taste. Pilsners are identified by their participation in categories like &quot;European-Style Pilsner&quot; at the [[World Beer Cup]] or other similar competitions.

Beer called &quot;Pilsner&quot; is seldom very strong. The alcohol strength is typical around 4.5 % (by volume). If pilsner is brewed stronger, it usually is labeled as &quot;Export Beer&quot; instead.

==Style Creation==
Pilsner beer is generally regarded as different from a [[lager]], but is actually a style of lager. It uses a partially malted [[barley]], giving it a lighter flavor, with no roasted or smoked flavor that was commonly found in Germany at the time. The first pilsner was created using [[saaz hops]] and credited to [[Bavaria]]n [[brewer]] [[Josef Groll]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://beer.about.com/od/lager/a/PilsnerHistory.htm|title=History of Pilsner|author=Bryce Eddings|accessdate=February 24, 2012|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice beer''' is a marketing term for [[pale lager]] beer brands which have undergone some degree of [[fractional freezing]] somewhat similar to the German [[Eisbock]] production method. These brands generally have higher alcohol content than typical beer and generally have a low price relative to their alcohol content.&lt;ref name=AverageEthanol/&gt;

==Process==
The process of &quot;icing&quot; beer involves lowering the temperature of a batch of beer until [[ice|ice crystals]] form.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Since alcohol has a lower freezing point than water and doesn't form crystals, when the ice is filtered off, the alcohol concentration increases. The process is known as &quot;fractional freezing&quot; or &quot;freeze distillation&quot;.

==History==
[[Eisbock]] was developed in [[Germany]] during [[Oktoberfest]] celebrations{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} with [[bock|bock beers]], which are strong lagers. A particularly cold year froze the beers and a new taste was noticed by the drinkers.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, in its current form, ice beer was developed from the fruit-juice industry which used to freeze [[orange juice]] [[concentrate]] in order to reduce shipping costs.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The term &quot;ice beer&quot; (in name) was introduced in Canada by [[Molson]] (now part of [[Molson Coors Brewing Company|Molson Coors]]). The first ice beer marketed in North America was ''Canadian Ice,'' which was introduced by Molson in April 1993,&lt;ref name=NYT93&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DD1E38F930A3575BC0A965958260 Company News: New Brew From Molson; U.S.'s Northern Neighbor Is Putting Ice in the Beer], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 3, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; although the process was patented earlier by Molson's competitor, [[Labatt Brewing Company|Labatt]] (now part of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]), instigating the so-called &quot;Ice Beer Wars&quot; of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt; [http://archives.cbc.ca/economy_business/business/clip/8736/ Ice Beer Wars], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], April 14, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  By August of 1993, both Molson and Labatt had introduced ice beer products in Canada, with Labatt having captured a 10% market share.&lt;ref name=NYT93/&gt; These ice beers are brewed and filtered at sub-freezing temperatures, thus producing ice crystals and raising the resulting alcohol content. Labatt's ''Maximum Ice,'' for example, rates 7.1% abv.&lt;ref name=NYT93/&gt; The freezing of beer allowed the removal of protein-polyphenol compounds, creating a smoother, more colloidally stable beer, and avoiding long aging time.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Miller Brewing|Miller]] acquired the U.S. marketing and distribution rights to Molson's products, and first introduced the Molson product in the United States in August 1993 as ''Molson Ice''.&lt;ref name=NYT93/&gt; Miller also introduced the ''Icehouse'' brand under the ''Plank Road Brewery'' brand name shortly thereafter,{{when|date=March 2012}} and it is still sold nationwide.

[[Anheuser-Busch]] introduced ''Bud Ice'' (5.5% abv) in 1994 and it remains one of the country's top-selling ice beers. ''Bud Ice'' has a somewhat lower alcohol content than most other ice beer brands. In 1995, Anheuser-Busch also introduced two other major brands: ''Busch Ice'' (5.9% abv, introduced 1995) and ''Natural Ice'' (also 5.9% abv, also introduced in 1995).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} ''Natural Ice'' is the No. 1 selling ice beer brand in the United States; its low price makes it very popular on college campuses all over the country.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Characteristics and regulation==
The ice beers are typically known for their high alcohol-to-dollar ratio.&lt;ref name=AverageEthanol&gt;The Average Ethanol Content of Beer in the U.S. and Individual States: Estimates for Use in Aggregate Consumption Statistics; William C. Kerr, Thomas K. Greenfield; Journal of Studies on Alcohol, Vol. 64, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, a substantial number of ice beer products are considered to often be bought by &quot;street drunks&quot;, and are prohibited for sale.&lt;ref&gt;McNerthney, Casey, [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/City-looks-at-banning-high-octane-booze-in-more-3419060.php City Looks at Banning High-Octane Booze in More Areas], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', March 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most of the products that are explicitly listed as prohibited in the the beer and malt liquor category in the [[Seattle]] area are ice beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liq.wa.gov/publications/seattle09banprodlist.pdf Amended Banned Products List, Seattle Alcohol Impact Areas], Washington State Liquor Control Board, effective date March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although &quot;icing&quot; increases alcohol content, most of the United States breweries simply add water back into their beer after the icing process to bring the alcohol content back down to nearly the same levels.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Otherwise the beer would qualify as a &quot;beer concentrate,&quot; which is illegal under ATF rules governing beer production.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.ttb.gov/rulings/94-3.htm 27 CFR 7.24: CLASS AND TYPE], (the definition of the term &quot;concentrate&quot; does not include a beer from which a small quantity of water has been removed), (also sec. 25.11, 25.261, 25.263)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flanders red ale''' is a style of [[sour ale]] usually brewed in [[Belgium]]. Although sharing a common ancestor with English [[Porter_(beer)|porters]] of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, G. &amp; Roger Protz. ''Brew Your Own British Real Ale at Home'', CAMRA Books, 1996. ISBN 1-85249-138-8&lt;/ref&gt; the Flanders red ale has evolved along a different track: the beer is often [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] with organisms other than ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', especially ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', which produces a sour character attributable to [[lactic acid]]. Long periods of aging are employed, a year or more, often in [[oak]]en barrels, to impart an [[acetic acid]] character to the beer. Special red [[malt]] is used to give the beer its unique color and often the matured beer is blended with a younger batch before bottling to balance and round the character.

Flanders reds have a strong fruit flavor similar to the aroma, but more intense. Plum, prune, raisin and raspberry are the most common flavors, followed by orange and some spiciness. All Flanders red ales have an obvious sour or acidic taste, but this characteristic can range from moderate to strong. There is no hop bitterness, but [[tannins]] are common. Consequently, Flanders red ales are often described as the most &quot;wine-like&quot; of all beers. 

Notable examples include [[Duchesse de Bourgogne (beer)|Duchesse de Bourgogne]][http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/641/1745] and [[Rodenbach]].

'''Brown ale''' is a [[style of beer]] with a dark amber or brown colour. The term was first used by London brewers in the late 17th century to describe their products, such as mild ale,&lt;ref&gt;David Sutla, Mild Ale, 1999, Brewers Publications, Page 26&lt;/ref&gt; though the term had a rather different meaning than it does today. 18th-century brown ales were lightly hopped and brewed from 100% brown malt.&lt;ref&gt;London and Country Brewer, Anonymous, 1736, pages 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are brown ales made in several regions, most notably [[English beer|England]], [[Belgian beer|Belgium]] and [[American beer|North America]]. Beers termed brown ale include sweet, low alcohol beers such as Manns Original Brown Ale, medium strength amber beers of moderate bitterness such as [[Newcastle Brown Ale]], and malty but hoppy beers such as [[Sierra Nevada Brewing Company|Sierra Nevada]] Brown Ale.

==History==
In the 18th century, British brown ales were brewed to a variety of strengths, with [[gravity (alcoholic beverage)|gravities]] ranging from around 1.060º to 1.090º.&lt;ref&gt;London and Country Brewer, Anonymous, 1736, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; These beers died out around 1800 as brewers moved away from using brown malt as a base. Pale malt, being cheaper because of its higher yield, was used as a base for all beers, including Porter and Stout.  

The term &quot;brown ale&quot; was revived at the end of the 19th century when London brewer Mann introduced a beer with that name. However, the style only became widely brewed in the 1920s. The brown ales of this period were considerably stronger than most modern English versions. In 1926, Manns Brown Ale had a gravity of 1.043º and an ABV of around 4%.&lt;ref&gt;Truman &quot;Gravity Book&quot; document number B/THB/C/252 held at the London Metropolitan Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitbread Double Brown was even stronger, 1.054º and more than 5% ABV.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Whitbread brewing records held at the London Metropolitan Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of these beers coincided with a big increase in demand for bottled beer in the UK. 

In the 1930s some breweries, such as Whitbread, introduced a second weaker and cheaper brown ale that was sometimes just a sweetened version of dark Mild. These beers had a gravity of around 1.037º.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

After World War II, stronger brown ales, with the exception of a handful of examples from the northeast of England, mostly died out. The majority were in the range 1.030-1.035º, or around 3% ABV, much like Manns Brown Ale today.&lt;ref&gt;Whitbread Gravity Book, Document number LMA/4453/D/02/002, held at the London Metropolitan Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North America]]n brown ales trace their heritage to American [[home brewing]] adaptations of certain northern [[England|English]] beers, and the English influence on American Colonial Ales.

==Description==
English brown ales range from beers such as Manns Original Brown Ale,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refreshuk.com/brands/brands_manns.htm Manns Brown Ale - a bottle with real character&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which is quite sweet and low in alcohol, to northeastern brown ale such as [[Newcastle Brown Ale]], [[Double Maxim Beer Company|Double Maxim]] and [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale]]. North American examples include [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Sam Adams]] Brown Ale and [[Brooklyn Brewery|Brooklyn]] Brown Ale.

They range from deep [[amber]] to brown in colour. [[Caramel (aroma)|Caramel]] and [[chocolate]] flavours are evident. Brown ales from northeastern England tend to be strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight [[citrus]] accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to [[List of hop varieties|American hop varieties]]. Fruitiness from [[ester]]s are subdued.  When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.

'''Mild ale''' is a low-[[Gravity (beer)|gravity]] beer, or beer with a predominantly malty palate, that originated in Britain in the 17th century or earlier. Modern mild ales are mainly dark coloured with an [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] of 3% to 3.6%, though there are lighter hued examples, as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.

The term ''mild'' originally meant young beer or ale as opposed to &quot;stale&quot; aged beer or ale with its resulting &quot;tang&quot;. In more recent times it has been interpreted as denoting &quot;mildly [[hops|hopped]]&quot;.

Light mild is generally similar, but pale in colour. There is some overlap between the weakest styles of [[Bitter (beer)|bitter]] and light mild, with the term AK being used to refer to both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/98/ Martyn Cornell on AK]&lt;/ref&gt; The designation of such beers as &quot;bitter&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; has tended to change with fashion. A good example is McMullen's AK, which was re-badged as a bitter after decades as a light mild. AK (a very common beer name in the 19th century) was often referred to as a &quot;mild bitter beer&quot; interpreting &quot;mild&quot; as &quot;unaged&quot;.

Once sold in every pub, mild experienced a catastrophic fall in popularity after the 1960s and was in danger of completely disappearing. However, in recent years the explosion of microbreweries has led to a modest renaissance and an increasing number of milds (sometimes labelled &quot;Dark&quot;) are now being brewed.

The [[Campaign for Real Ale]] has designated May as &quot;Mild Month&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Mild&quot; was originally used to designate any beer which was young, fresh or unaged and did not refer to a specific style of beer. Thus there was Mild Ale but also Mild Porter and even Mild Bitter Beer. These young beers were often blended with aged &quot;stale&quot; beer to improve their flavour. As the 19th century progressed and public taste moved away from the aged taste, unblended young beer, mostly in the form of Mild Ale or Light Bitter Beer, began to dominate the market.

In the 19th century a typical brewery produced three or four mild ales, usually designated by a number of X's, the weakest being X, the strongest XXXX. They were considerably stronger than the milds of today, with the gravity ranging from around 1.055 to 1.072 (about 5.5% to 7% abv). Gravities dropped throughout the late 19th century and by 1914 the weakest milds were down to about 1.045, still considerably stronger than modern versions.

The draconian measures applied to the brewing industry during the [[First World War]] had a particularly dramatic effect upon mild. As the biggest-selling beer, it suffered the largest cut in gravity when breweries had to limit the average OG of their beer to 1.030. In order to be able to produce some stronger beer - which was exempt from price controls and thus more profitable - mild was reduced to 1.025 or lower.

Modern dark mild varies from dark amber to near-black in colour and is very light-bodied. Its flavour is dominated by malt, sometimes with roasty notes derived from the use of black malt, with a subdued hop character, though there are some quite bitter examples. Most are in the range 1.030–1.036 (3–3.6% abv).

Light mild is generally similar, but paler in colour. Some dark milds are created by the addition of caramel to a pale beer.

Until the 1960s mild was the most popular beer style in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://zythophile.wordpress.com/the-best-book-on-british-beer-styles/&lt;/ref&gt; Pockets of demand remain, particularly in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[North West England]], but has been largely ousted by [[bitter (beer)|bitter]] and lager elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Good Beer Guide 2006, ISBN 1-85249-211-2, p28&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, only 1.3% of beer sold in pubs was Mild.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Handbook 2003, British Beer and Pub Association, ISSN 1475-3545, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Mild's popularity in Wales, in particular, persisted as a relatively low-alcohol, sweet drink for [[coal mining|coal miners]]. Some brewers have continued to produce mild, but have find it sells better under a different name: for instance, Banks's mild was renamed Original. Outside the United Kingdom, Mild is virtually unknown, with the exception of Old in New South Wales and some microbrewery recreations in North America and Scandinavia.

==Brown and Mild==
A popular drink in the West Midlands, &quot;Brown and Mild&quot; is a mix of half a pint of mild and a bottle of Brown Ale in a pint glass.  In the North West of England a mixture of half a pint of mild and half a pint of bitter is known as a &quot;mixed&quot;.

==Brewing==
Mild ales are generally based on [[mash ingredients#Barley|mild malt or pale malt]]. Most milds contain, in addition, a quantity of crystal malt; dark milds, meanwhile, make use of chocolate malt, black malt or dark brewing sugars. Milds tend to be lightly hopped compared to [[pale ale]] and are usually low in alcohol; strong mild ales used to reach six or seven per cent [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], but very few such beers are still brewed. Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby Mild, brewed to a pre-WWI recipe, is a rare example of a strong Mild (6.0% ABV).

[[Image:Fullers london porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Fullers London Porter]]
[[Image:Porter Stout.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie Porter]]
'''Porter''' is a dark [[Beer style|style]] of [[beer]] originating in [[London]] in the 18th Century, &lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Horst, and Garrett Oliver. &quot;Porter.&quot; The Oxford Companion to Beer. Ed. Garrett Oliver. 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; descended from brown beer, a well hopped beer made from brown malt.&lt;ref&gt;''Amber, Gold &amp; Black''; Cornell, Martyn; The History Press UK, 2010, p.54 &lt;/ref&gt; The name came about as a result of its popularity with street and river [[porter (carrier)|porters]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Picture of London&quot;, John Feltham, 1802, p26, states it &quot;obtained the name porter&quot; because it was &quot;very suitable for porters and other working people&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history and development of [[stout]] and porter are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180680 |title=Porter and Stout |publisher=CAMRA |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name &quot;stout&quot; for a dark beer is believed to have come about because a strong porter may be called &quot;Extra Porter&quot; or &quot;Double Porter&quot; or &quot;Stout Porter&quot;. The term &quot;Stout Porter&quot; would later be shortened to just &quot;[[Stout]]&quot;. For example, [[Guinness]] Extra Stout was originally called &quot;Extra Superior Porter&quot; and was only given the name Extra Stout in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Guinness’s Brewery in the Irish Economy 1759-1876&quot;, Patrick Lynch and John Vaizey, pages 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===18th and 19th Century===
In 1802, a writer named John Feltham wrote a version of the history of porter that has been used as the basis for most writings on the topic. However, very little of Feltham's story is backed up by contemporary evidence. His account is based upon a letter written by [[Obadiah Poundage]] (who had worked for decades in the London brewing trade) in the 1760s. Unfortunately, Feltham badly misinterpreted parts of the text, mainly due to his unfamiliarity with 18th century brewing terminology.&lt;ref&gt;''Amber, Gold &amp; Black''; Cornell, Martyn; The History Press UK, 2010, p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt;  Feltham claimed that in 18th century London a popular beverage called &quot;three threads&quot; was made consisting of a third of a pint each of [[ale]], [[beer]] and ''twopenny'' (the strongest beer, costing [[tuppence]] a quart). About 1730, Feltham said, a brewer called Harwood made a single beer called ''Entire'', which recreated the flavour of &quot;three threads&quot; and became known as &quot;porter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jbsummer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cyclopedia | name = Rees | year = 1819 | volume = 38 | url = http://www.jbsumner.com/pages/brewinghistory/transcripts/rees.html | others = Online edition transcribed by James Sumner | chapter = Porter}}{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter is actually mentioned as early as 1721, but no writer before Feltham says it was made to replicate &quot;three threads&quot;. Instead, it seems to be a more-aged development of the brown beers already being made in London.&lt;ref&gt;''Amber, Gold &amp; Black''; Cornell, Martyn; The History Press UK, 2010, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1700, London brewers sent out their beer very young and any aging was either performed by the publican or a dealer. Porter was the first beer to be aged at the brewery and dispatched in a condition fit to be drunk immediately. It was the first beer that could be made on any large scale, and the London porter brewers, such as [[Whitbread]], [[Old Truman Brewery|Truman]], [[Parsons (brewer)|Parsons]] and [[Henry Thrale|Thrale]], achieved great success financially.

Early London porters were strong beers by modern standards. Early trials with the hydrometer in the 1770s recorded porter as having an OG ([[original gravity]]) of 1.071° and 6.6% ABV.&lt;ref&gt;“A History of Beer and Brewing” Ian S. Hornsey, 2003 p.436&lt;/ref&gt; Increased taxation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] pushed its gravity down to around 1.055°, where it remained for the rest of the 19th century. The huge popularity of the style prompted brewers to produce porters in a wide variety of strengths. These started with Single Stout Porter at around 1.066°, Double Stout Porter (such as [[Guinness]]) at 1.072°, Triple Stout Porter at 1.078° and [[Imperial Stout]] Porter at 1.095° and more. As the 19th century progressed the porter suffix was gradually dropped. British brewers, however, continued to use porter as the generic term for both porters and stouts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The large London porter breweries pioneered many technological advances, such as the use of the [[thermometer]] (about 1760) and the [[hydrometer]] (1770). The use of the latter was to transform the nature of porter. The first porters were brewed from 100% brown malt. Now brewers were able to accurately measure the yield of the malt they used, and it was noticed that brown malt, though cheaper than pale malt, only produced about two thirds as much fermentable material. When the malt tax was increased to help pay for the [[Napoleonic War]], brewers had an incentive to use less malt. Their solution was to use a proportion of pale malt and add colouring to obtain the expected hue. When a law was passed in 1816 allowing only malt and [[hops]] to be used in the production of beer (a sort of British [[Reinheitsgebot]]), they were left in a quandary. Their problem was solved by Wheeler's invention of the almost black [[patent malt]] in 1817. It was now possible to brew porter from 95% pale malt and 5% [[patent malt]], though most London brewers continued to use some brown malt for flavour.&lt;ref name=&quot;lma&quot;&gt;Whitbread brewing records held at the London Metropolitan Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Until about 1800, all London porter was matured in large vats, often holding several hundred barrels, for between six and eighteen months before being racked into smaller casks to be delivered to pubs. It was discovered that it was unnecessary to age all porter. A small quantity of highly aged beer (18 months or more) mixed with fresh or &quot;mild&quot; porter produced a flavour similar to that of aged beer. It was a cheaper method of producing porter, as it required less beer to be stored for long periods. The normal blend was around two  parts young beer to one part old.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Brewer&quot; by William Loftus, 1863 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1860, as the popularity of porter and the aged taste began to wane, porter was increasingly sold &quot;mild&quot;. In the final decades of the century, many breweries discontinued their porter, though continued to brew one or two stouts. Those that persisted with porter, brewed it weaker and with fewer [[hops]]. Between 1860 and 1914, the gravity dropped from 1.058° to 1.050° and the hopping rate from two pounds to one pound per 36 gallon barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;lma&quot;/&gt;

===20th and 21st Century===
During the [[World War I|First World War]] in Britain, shortages of grain led to restrictions on the strength of beer. Less strict rules were applied in Ireland, allowing Irish brewers such as [[Guinness]] to continue to brew beers closer to pre-war strengths. English breweries continued to brew a range of bottled, and sometimes draught, stouts until the [[World War II|Second World War]] and beyond. They were considerably weaker than the pre-war versions (down from 1.055°-1.060° to 1.040-1.042°) and around the strength that porter had been in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;lma&quot;/&gt; The drinking of Porter, with its strength slot now occupied by single stout, steadily declined, and production ceased around 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;lma&quot;/&gt; 

A revival of the style began in 1979, when the Penrhos microbrewery introduced a porter. A little later, Timothy Taylor began to brew a porter as well. There are now dozens of breweries in Britain making porter, with [[Fuller's Brewery|Fuller's]] 'London Porter' winning gold and silver medals at the 1999, 2000 and 2002 International Beer &amp; Cider Competitions, and [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]]'s Supreme [[Champion Winter Beer of Britain]] silver medal in 2007, with [[Wickwar Brewery]]'s 'Station Porter' winning gold in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullers-ales.com/london_porter.php |title=Fuller's Brewery |publisher=Fullers-ales.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=268535 |title=‘Station Porter' steams in to be voted Best Winter Beer In The Land!|publisher=Camra.org.uk |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wickwarbrewing.co.uk/latest-news/news/latest-news/-station-porter-supreme-champion-winter-beer-of-britain-2008.html Wickwar Brewing]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many breweries brew porters in wide varieties, including, but not limited to, pumpkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourpeaks.com/moreBeers.asp |title=Four Peaks Brewery - Tempe, Arizona |publisher=Fourpeaks.com |date=2004-04-27 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; honey, vanilla, chocolate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/index.cfm?pid=120996 |title=Chocolate Stout - Limited Edition - Harpoon Brewery - Brewers of Harpoon IPA and UFO Hefeweizen |publisher=Harpoon Brewery |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bourbon. Specialized porter brews continue the tradition of aging in barrels, and the use of bourbon [[aging barrel|barrel]]s is not uncommon.

In addition, [[Okells]] on the [[Isle Of Man]] utilise peated malt made from selected barley that uses burning peat during the malting process.

== Porter in Ireland ==
Porter was first brewed in Ireland in 1776. [[Guinness]] introduced theirs in 1778, although they continued to brew ale as well until 1799.

In Ireland, especially Dublin, the drink was known as &quot;plain porter&quot; or just &quot;plain&quot;. This is the drink referred to in [[Flann O'Brien]]'s poem &quot;The Workman's Friend&quot;: &quot;A pint of plain is your only man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'', Flann O'Brien, ISBN 1-56478-181-X.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, extra-strong porter was called ''Stout Porter''. The last [[Guinness]] Irish porter was produced in 1974.

After the invention of malted barley roasted until black to impart a darker colour and distinct burnt taste to the beer in 1817, Irish brewers dropped the use of [[brown malt]], using [[patent malt]] and [[pale malt]] only, while English brewers continued using some brown malt, giving a difference in style between English and Irish porters.

== Porter elsewhere ==
A version known as [[Baltic porter]] is brewed in [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]. Baltic porter was introduced from Britain in the 18th century as a [[top-fermenting]] beer and remained so until the second half of the 19th century when many breweries began to brew their porter with a lager yeast.

In [[Germany]], Baltic porter was brewed from the mid-19th century to [[German reunification]]. In 1990, all German porter producing breweries were in former [[East Germany]], and none survived the transition to a [[market economy]]. The late 1990s saw to the re-launch of Baltic porters by several German breweries. 

Porter was being commercially brewed in America in the 18th century, especially in New England and Pennsylvania. After the introduction of lagers in the United States in the 1850s, breweries began brewing their porters with lager yeast rather than a [[top-fermenting]] one. In addition, these American porters often included adjuncts such as maize, molasses, and Porterine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brewingtechniques.com/library/styles/porterstyl.html |title=American Porters: Marching to Revolutionary Drummers - Brewing Techniques |publisher=brewingtechniques.com |date=unknown |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wheat beer''' is a [[beer]] that is [[brewing|brewed]] with a large proportion of [[wheat]] in addition to [[malt]]ed [[barley]]. Wheat beers are usually [[top-fermenting|top-fermented]] (as required by law in Germany).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Eric Warner, ''German Wheat Beer.'' Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. ISBN 978-0-937381-34-2&lt;/ref&gt; The main varieties are [[#Weissbier|weissbier]], [[#Witbier|witbier]], and the sour varieties, such as [[lambic]], [[Berliner Weisse]] and [[gose]].

==Varieties==
Two common varieties of wheat beer are witbier (Dutch – &quot;white beer&quot;) based on the Belgian tradition of using flavourings such as [[coriander]] and [[orange (fruit)|orange]] peel which was revived by [[Pierre Celis]] at the [[Hoegaarden Brewery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PhfWmUsaOB4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Pierre+Celis#v=onepage&amp;q=Pierre%20Celis&amp;f=false |title=Belgium and Luxembourg – Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2009|isbn=9781741042375|author1=Logan|first1=Leanne|last2=Cole|first2=Geert|date=2007-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000215.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter – Belgium's Great Beers |publisher=www.beerhunter.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Celis]] Brewery in Austin Texas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Jackson |title=Pocket Guide to Beer |format=Hardcover |pages=208 |publisher=Running Press |edition=7 |date=10 August 2000 |isbn=0762408855}} ISBN 978-0762408856.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lisheron&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20020311075809/http://www.austin360.com/aas/dining/beer01/celis01.html |last1=Lisheron |first1=Mark |date=21 February 2001 |title=Last call for a Celis: Whether you blame the beer big boys, Texas tastes or marketing mistakes, a great little Austin brewery is gone |publisher=[[Austin American Statesman]] |accessdate=26 April 2012}} at [[Wayback machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belgianbeerspecialist.blogspot.com/2011/04/pierre-celis-conversation-in-hoegaarden.html |date=20 April 2011 |first1=David |last1=Cook |title=Pierre Celis: A Conversation in Hoegaarden |work=Belgian Beer and Travel|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and weissbier (German – &quot;white beer&quot;) based on the German tradition of mixing at least 50% wheat to barley malt to make a light coloured top-fermenting beer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Belgian witbier and the German weissbier were termed &quot;white beers&quot; because historically they are pale unfiltered and have a hazy appearance due to the type of yeast. Belgian white beers are often made with raw unmalted wheat, as opposed to the malted wheat used in other varieties.

German wheat beers are called weizen (&quot;wheat&quot;) in the western ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) and northern regions, and weissbier or weiss (&quot;white beer&quot; or &quot;white&quot;) in [[Bavaria]]. Hefeweizen (the prefix &quot;hefe&quot; is German for [[yeast]]) is the name for unfiltered wheat beers, while kristallweizen (&quot;kristall&quot; being German for crystal) is the same beer filtered.

[[Breweries]] in other countries, particularly the [[Beer in the United States|U.S.]] and [[Beer in Canada|Canada]], will brew wheat beers based on these two main traditions using special wheat beer yeasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Brew: Ingredients, Methods, Recipes, and Equipment for Brewing Beer at Home|last=Palmer|first=John|publisher=Defenestrative Pub Co|year=2001|isbn=0-9710579-0-7|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sour beers such as [[Berliner Weisse]], [[gose]], and [[lambic]] are made with a significant proportion of wheat.

In [[Beer in England|Britain]], wheat beer is not considered traditional, but several brewers produce cask-conditioned varieties, such as [[Fuller, Smith and Turner|Fuller's]] ''Discovery'', [[Oakleaf Brewery|Oakleaf]] ''Eichenblatt Bitte'', [[Hoskins Brothers Ales|Hoskins]] ''White Dolphin'', [[Fyfe Brewing Company|Fyfe]] ''Weiss Squad'' and [[Oakham Ales|Oakham]] ''White Dwarf''. British wheat beer tends to be a hybrid of the continental style with an English bitter, rather than an exact emulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/tierney-jones-a/wheatbeer.php Adrian Tierney-Jones]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheat beers are commonly marketed as spring or summer seasonal products.

===Weissbier {{anchor|Weissbier}}===
[[File:Hefeweizen and kristallweizen.jpg|thumb|right|A kristallweizen (left) and a hefeweizen (right)]]

Weissbier, sometimes weißbier (&quot;white beer&quot;), also known as Weizen(bier) (&quot;wheat beer&quot;), is a [[Bavaria]]n beer in which a significant proportion of [[malt]]ed [[barley]] is replaced with malted [[wheat]]. By German law, weissbiers brewed in Germany must be top-fermented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt; Specialized strains of [[yeast]] are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermentation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt; Weissbier is so called because it was, at the time of its inception, paler in colour than Munich brown beer. It is well-known throughout Germany, though better known as weizen (&quot;wheat&quot;) outside Bavaria. The terms hefeweizen (&quot;yeast wheat&quot;) or hefeweissbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or kristall weiss (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is [[Filtered beer|filtered]] to remove the yeast from suspension. Additionally, the filtration process removes wheat proteins present in the beer which contribute to its cloudy appearance.

The hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 [[IBUs]]) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer's relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavour note unique to hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is [[2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol|4-vinyl guaiacol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donaghy|first=John A.|coauthors=Paul F. Kelly, Alan McKay|title=Conversion of ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol by yeasts isolated from unpasteurised apple juice|journal=Society of Chemical Industry|date=15 October 1998|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/61003783/ABSTRACT|accessdate=28 July 2010|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(19990301)79:3&lt;453::AID-JSFA284&gt;3.0.CO;2-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; a metabolite of [[ferulic acid]], the result of fermentation by top-fermenting yeast appropriate for the style. ''Hefeweizen'''s phenolic character has been described as &quot;clove&quot; and &quot;medicinal&quot; (&quot;Band-aid&quot;) but also smoky. Other more typical but less assertive flavour notes produced by Weissbier yeast include &quot;banana&quot; ([[amyl acetate]]), &quot;bubble gum&quot;, and sometimes &quot;vanilla&quot; ([[vanillin]]).

Weissbier is available in a number of other forms including dunkelweizen (dark wheat) and weizenstarkbier (strong wheat beer), commonly referred to as weizenbock. The dark wheat varieties are made with darker, more highly-kilned malts (both wheat and barley). The weizenbocks typically have a much higher alcohol content than their lighter cousins.

Some prominent commercial examples of hefeweizen are produced by Hopf, [[Paulaner]], Weltenburger Kloster, [[Tucher]], [[Erdinger]], [[G. Schneider &amp; Sohn|Schneider Weisse]] (original amber only), [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu|Franziskaner]], Schweiger, [[Hacker-Pschorr]], [[Ayinger]] (Bräu Weisse), [[Weihenstephan]]er, and [[Widmer Brothers]]. The style is currently consumed throughout Germany, but is especially popular in its Southern German homeland.

===Witbier===
Witbier, white beer, (French: bière blanche), or simply witte is a barley/wheat, top-fermented [[beer]] brewed mainly in [[Beer in Belgium|Belgium]] and the [[Beer in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. It is a descendant from those medieval beers which were not brewed with [[hops]], but instead flavoured and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants referred to as &quot;[[gruit]]&quot;. It therefore still uses gruit, although nowadays the gruit consists mainly of [[coriander]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[bitter orange]], and hops. The taste is therefore only slightly hoppy. The beers have a somewhat [[sour]] taste due to the presence of [[Lactic acid#Lactic acid in foods|lactic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot;&gt;[http://www.allaboutbeer.com/style/23.4-witbier.html Belgian Witbier&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.parc.com/emdl/members/apte/GingerBeer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle.

Witbier differs from other varieties of wheat beer in the use of [[gruit]]. French regulation (the territory was French in the 14th century) excluded the use of hops in gruit. Witbier can be made with [[Mash_ingredients#Wheat|raw wheat]], in addition to wheat [[malt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L8RwjqUKLygC&amp;pg=PT101&amp;dq=Witbier+raw+wheat#v=onepage&amp;q=Witbier%20raw%20wheat&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Brewing: Processes ... – Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2009|isbn=9783527316748|author1=Eßlinger|first1=Hans Michael|date=2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, some Belgian brewers have been making fruit flavoured wheat beers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Sour varieties===
{{Main|Berliner Weisse|Lambic }}
A minor variety of wheat beer is represented by Berliner Weisse (Berlin White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and quite tart. Although it can be imbibed by itself, enthusiasts often add sweetened syrups of lemon, raspberry or [[Galium odoratum|woodruff]] herb into the beer.

Leipziger [[Gose]] is similar to Berliner Weisse but slightly stronger at around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which are unusual for German beers. Both [[Gose]] and Berliner Weisse acquire their sourness through the use of lactic acid bacteria in the fermentation in addition to yeast.

The Belgian [[lambic]] is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from witbier in its yeast. Lambic is a brew of spontaneous [[Brewing#Fermenting|fermentation]].

==Names and types ==
According to the place in which the beer is brewed and small variations on the recipe, several different names are used for wheat beer:

* Weißbier, short Weiße: these terms are used almost exclusively in the southern German state of [[Bavaria]]. &quot;Weisse&quot; is German for &quot;white&quot;.
* Weizenbier, short Weizen: these names are used to indicate the same thing. &quot;Weizen&quot; is German for &quot;wheat&quot;.
* Hefeweissbier or Hefeweizen: &quot;hefe&quot; is the German word for yeast. The prefix is added to indicate that the beer is [[bottle-conditioned]] (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment.
* Kristallweissbier or Kristallweizen: if the weissbier is filtered, the beer will look &quot;clear&quot; (or &quot;kristall&quot;).
* Dunkles Weissbier or Dunkles Weizen: a dark version of a wheat beer (&quot;dunkel&quot; is the German word for &quot;dark&quot;).
* Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the [[bock]] [[beer style|style]] originating in Germany. An example of this style is ''Aventinus'', made by the [[G. Schneider &amp; Sohn]] [[brewery]] in [[Kelheim]], Germany.
* Witbier or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer.
* La bière blanche (Literally, &quot;white beer&quot;): The French language name for this type of beer.

==Serving ==
Bavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in 500 ml, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 25cl glass, although there is no standard shape. Berliner Weisse is often served in a [[schooner (glass)|schooner]].

Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass; this is generally frowned upon in Bavaria.&lt;ref name = &quot;Warner&quot; /&gt;

In northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer lasting foam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&amp;display_lang=en Weizenbier or wheat beer]&lt;/ref&gt;
A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is [[Shandy|cola-weizen]], which is a mix of cola and weizenbier. Often this is referred to as a &quot;Neger&quot; – a pejorative German term for a person of African descent. If weizen-bock is used instead of normal weizen it is called a &quot;Turbo-Neger&quot;.

Another mixture popular during the summer is a 50–50 mix of Weissbier with lemonade, called &quot;Russ&quot;. The German term for Russian

In different parts of Germany bananenweizen (wheat beer with banana nectar mixed in) is very popular, as well as cola-weizen which consists of equal parts of wheat beer and some sort of cola.

==Sensory profile==

Weissbiers feature fermentation by-products such as [[ester]]s (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially [[amyl acetate]], reminiscent of bananas, and the [[natural phenol|phenolic compound]] [[guaiacol]], a metabolite of [[ferulic acid]], which smells and tastes like [[clove]]s. Other phenolics sometimes found in Weissbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Weissbiers is close to 15 [[International Bitterness Units]], a relatively low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt;

The ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill. 

The [[carbonation]] level can range from 5.5&amp;nbsp;grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7&amp;nbsp;grams per liter, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially in light of the high protein content of wheat malt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;/&gt;

'''Steam beer''' may be defined as a highly [[effervescent]] beer made by brewing lager yeasts at warm fermentation temperatures. It has two distinct but related meanings:

*Historic steam beer produced in California from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century;
*Modern '''California common beer''', the official name for the beer family which includes Anchor Steam beer.

Historic steam beer, associated with [[San Francisco]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]], was brewed with [[lager]] yeast without the use of [[refrigeration]]. It was an improvised process, originating out of necessity, perhaps as early as the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]. It was considered a cheap and low-quality beer{{Synthesis-inline|date=March 2012}}, as shown by [[#Steam beer in literature|references to it in literature of the 1890s and 1900s]].

Modern steam beer, also known as ''California common beer,'' was originated by [[Anchor Brewing Company]], which trademarked the name Anchor Steam Beer in 1981. Although the modern company has corporate continuity with a small brewery which was still making traditional steam beer in the 1950s, Anchor Steam beer is a craft-brewed lager. The company does not claim any close similarity between its present day product and turn-of-the-20th-century steam beer.

Explanations of the word &quot;steam&quot; are all speculative. The carbon dioxide pressure produced by the process was very high, and one possibility is that it was necessary to let off &quot;steam&quot; before attempting to dispense the beer. According to Anchor Brewing, the name &quot;steam&quot; came from the fact that the brewery had no way to effectively chill the boiling wort using traditional means. So they pumped the hot wort up to large, shallow, open-top bins on the roof of the brewery so that it would be rapidly chilled by the cool air blowing in off the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Thus while brewing, the brewery had a distinct cloud of steam around the roof let off by the wort as it cooled, hence the name.  It is also possible that the name derives from &quot;Dampfbier&quot; (literally &quot;steam beer&quot;), a traditional German beer that was also fermented at unusually high temperatures and that may have been known to 19th-century American brewers, many of whom were of German descent.

==Brewing process==
[[File:Dampfbier.jpg|thumb|125px|German ''Dampfbier'']]
In 19th-century California, not only ice, but even sources of naturally cold water, were probably unavailable to brewers. California brewers were forced to use lager yeast at higher ale temperatures.

Final flavors of beer are influenced by the strain of yeast and the fermentation temperature.  Lager yeast is best used at temperatures from {{convert|58|to|48|F|C}}.  Classic lagering of beers takes place over a period of time from weeks to many months at a temperature of {{convert|37|F|C}}.  Lager yeasts are ''bottom fermenting,'' which is to say that after fermentation they settle on the bottom of the fermenter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Home Brewing&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Joy of Home Brewing: 3rd Edition |last= Papazian |first= Charlie |authorlink= Charlie Papazian |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ale yeast is best used at temperatures from {{convert|55|to|75|F|C}}. Fermentation by ale yeasts produces a beer that has a distinctive ale flavor. Ale yeasts are [[top-fermenting]], that is they settle out on top of the wort after fermenting (fermentation itself takes place in a suspension).&lt;ref name=&quot;Home Brewing&quot;/&gt;  Steam Beer uses bottom fermenting lager yeasts at ale temperatures, which results in a very distinctive flavor profile that includes both ale and lager characteristics.

While steam beer is considered a specialty microbrew style of beer today, it was originally a cheap beer made for [[blue collar worker]]s. Wahl and Heinus's ''American Handy Book of Brewing and Malting'' (1902) describes California Steam Beer as “a very clear, refreshing drink, much consumed by the laboring classes.” And while Anchor Steam is an all-barley malt beer, additives were often used in the early days. According to the book, &quot;Malt alone, malt and grits, or raw cereals of any kind, and sugars, especially glucose, employed in the kettle to the extent of 33{{frac|1|3}} percent... Roasted malt or sugar coloring is used to give the favorite amber color of Munich beer.&quot;

==In literature==

[[Jack London]] refers to steam beer in his &quot;alcoholic memoir,&quot; ''[[Jack London#Nonfiction and autobiographical memoirs|John Barleycorn]]'', in a passage explaining how he started drinking in late-1880s San Francisco:

:The first day I worked in the bowling alley, the barkeeper, according to custom, called us boys up to have a drink after we had been setting up pins for several hours.  The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer.

As a budding writer, &quot;a wild band of young revolutionists invited me as the guest of honour to a beer bust&quot; and was challenged to a drinking contest.

:I'd show them, the young rascals.... These unlicked cubs who thought they could out-drink ''me!'' Faugh! It was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer...

[[Frank Norris]]'s 1899 novel ''[[McTeague]]'', set in San Francisco, sets the stage with a reference to steam beer in its opening paragraph:

:It was Sunday, and, according to his custom on that day, McTeague took his dinner at two in the afternoon at the car conductors' coffee-joint on Polk Street. He had a thick gray soup; heavy, underdone meat, very hot, on a cold plate; two kinds of vegetables; and a sort of suet pudding, full of strong butter and sugar. On his way back to his office, one block above, he stopped at Joe Frenna's saloon and bought a pitcher of steam beer. It was his habit to leave the pitcher there on his way to dinner.... By and by, gorged with steam beer, and overcome by the heat of the room, the cheap tobacco, and the effects of his heavy meal, he dropped off to sleep.

When he marries, his wife convinces him to adopt more refined habits:

:She broke him of the habit of eating with his knife, she caused him to substitute bottled beer in the place of steam beer, and she induced him to take off his hat to Miss Baker, to Heise's wife, and to the other women of his acquaintance.

==California common beer==

According to the [[Beer Judge Certification Program]], the term California common beer, designated style 7B, is &quot;narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example&quot;, and other commercial examples include [[Skyscraper Brewing Company]] Lug Nut Lager, Southampton West Coast Steam Beer, Old Dominion Victory Amber, Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber Lager, and Eagle Steam Beer. The style &quot;showcases the signature Northern Brewer hops (with woody, rustic or minty qualities) in moderate to high strength&quot;, is fermented with &quot;a lager yeast, but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of normal ale fermentation temperatures&quot;, and was traditionally fermented in open fermenters.

==Other kinds of &quot;steam beer&quot;==

A British brewery, the Lincolnshire Steam Beer Co., derives its name from the steam-powered brewing machinery.

When Canadian brewer [[Sleeman Breweries|Sleeman]] introduced a product called Steam Beer in Canada in 1999, Anchor sued for trademark infringement, since it had trademarked the term &quot;steam beer&quot; in Canada ten years earlier. Canadian courts dismissed the suit and subsequent appeals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Citation: Anchor Brewing Co. v. Sleeman Brewing &amp; Malting Co. Ltd., 2001 FCT 1066, (2001), 1 F.C. D-15, Docket: T-1158-99  | publisher = Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs Canada  | date = 2001-09-28  | url = http://reports.fja.gc.ca/eng/2001/2001fct1066/2001fct1066.html | accessdate = 2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruling that Anchor's Canadian trademark was invalid, since the beer had not been marketed in Canada up to that time. After [[Sapporo Brewery|Sapporo]] bought Sleeman in a $400-million takeover in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Sapporo acquisition of Sleeman on tap  | publisher = CBC News  | date = 2006-08-11  | url = http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2006/08/11/sapporo-sleeman.html | accessdate = 2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeman's production of Steam Beer was discontinued.

In Richmond, Virginia the remains of a former [[D. G. Yuengling &amp; Son|Yuengling]] brewery along the James River were once called &quot;David Yuengling Jr.'s James River Steam Brewery&quot; and are located at (or near) 912 East Main St.

'''Cream ale''' is a style of top-fermented American [[beer]] resembling a German [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]].

==Style==
A cream ale is related to [[pale lager]]. They are generally brewed to be light and refreshing with a straw to pale golden color. [[Hops|Hop]] and [[malt]] flavor is usually subdued but like all beer styles it is open to individual interpretation, so some [[breweries]] give them a more assertive character. The most notable example being [[Genesee Cream Ale]] (made by [[Genesee Brewing Company]] of [[Rochester, NY]]), &amp; Schoenling Little Kings, brewed by The Little Kings Brewing Company, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, &amp; coming in seven ounce 'pony' bottles.  

While cream ales are top-fermented [[ale]]s, they typically undergo an extended period of cold-conditioning or [[lager]]ing after primary fermentation is complete. This reduces fruity esters and gives the beer a cleaner flavor. Some examples also have a lager [[yeast]] added for the cold-conditioning stage or are mixes of ales and lagers. [[Adjuncts]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[rice]] are used to lighten the body and flavor, although all-malt examples are available.

==Smooth flow==
Smooth flow (also known as &quot;cream flow&quot; or just &quot;smooth&quot;) are descriptive names some brewers sometimes give to beers pressurized with nitrogen [[Widget (beer)|widgets]], whether in can, bottle, or mini-keg, as part of [[marketing|creating interest in the market]] for their beers.

[[File:Westmalle Tripel in a glass.jpg|thumb|right|Westmalle Tripel]]

'''Tripel''' is a term used by brewers mainly in the [[Low Countries]], some other European countries, and the USA to describe a [[strong pale ale]], loosely in the style of ''[[Westmalle Tripel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/styles/tripel.html
|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Beer Styles: Tripel
|publisher=www.beerhunter.com
|accessdate=2009-07-11
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term is unknown, though the main theory is that it indicates strength in some way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linden&quot;/&gt; It was used in 1956 by the [[Trappist brewery]], [[Westmalle Brewery|Westmalle]], to rename the strongest beer in their range, though both the term Tripel and the style of beer associated with the name (strong pale ale), were in existence before 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linden&quot;/&gt; The style of Westmalle's ''Tripel'' and the name was widely copied by the breweries of Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Beers of Belgium'', [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]], MMC, 1997, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1987 another Trappist brewery, the [[De Koningshoeven Brewery|Koningshoeven]] in the Netherlands, expanded their range with a beer called ''La Trappe Tripel'', though they also produced a stronger beer they termed ''La Trappe [[Quadrupel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Taste of Beer'', [[Roger Protz]], Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1998, page 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The term spread to the USA and other countries, and is applied by a range of secular brewers to a strong pale ale in the style of ''Westmalle Tripel''.&lt;ref&gt;''Belgian Ale'', Pierre Rajotte, Brewers publications, 1992, pages 31-34&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term Tripel comes from the [[Low Countries]] - that is the modern [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]; though the origin of the term is unknown. The two main theories are that it indicates strength, either by a series of marks, such as crosses, on a cask - X for the weakest strength, XX for medium strength, and XXX for the strongest beer, or by reference to the [[original gravity]] of a beer which roughly corresponds to 3% [[abv]], 6% abv and 9% abv.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linden&quot;/&gt;

The modern origin of tripels lies in Belgium, in the 1930s. According to brewing historian [[Michael Jackson (beer writer)|Michael Jackson]], the first golden [[strong pale ale]] associated with the term was brewed by Hendrik Verlinden of the Drie Linden (Three Lindens) brewery in the early 1930s, when ale brewers were looking to compete with the pale lagers from [[Plzeň]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Linden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Brew Like a Monk: Trappist, Abbey, and Strong Belgian Ales'', Stan Hieronymus, Brewers Publications, 2005. ISBN 0-937381-87-X&lt;/ref&gt; Verlinden regularly assisted the [[Trappist brewery]] Westmalle with their brewing,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Westmalle
|publisher=www.trappistbeer.net
|accessdate=2009-07-11
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1932 he produced a golden [[strong pale ale]], the ''Witkap Pater'' (now known as ''Witkap Tripel''), for his own brewery, the [[Slaghmuylder Brewery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.witkap.be/witkap_eng/History.html |title=Brewery Slaghmuylder |publisher=www.witkap.be |accessdate=2009-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Westmalle released a beer under the name ''Superbier''. It was a strong blonde ale and was very likely based on a blonde beer the monks had been brewing sporadically since 1931. In 1956 they renamed it ''Tripel'', and the popularity of that brand ensured the name is still strongly associated with the Westmalle brewery,&lt;ref&gt;''Heavenly Beer'', Roger Protz, Carroll &amp;Brown, 2002, page 125&lt;/ref&gt; though both the term Tripel and the style of beer associated with the name (strong pale ale), were in existence before 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linden&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956, the recipe was modified by [[Brother Thomas]], the head brewer of Westmalle,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; by the addition of more hops, and it then took on the name Tripel, it has remained essentially unchanged since.

Tim Webb in his ''Good Beer Guide to Belgium'' says that some of the pre-1956 beers called Tripel were dark, in contrast to the modern understanding of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Webb: ''Good Beer Guide to Belgium'', 6th edition, p82&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the [[Trappists|Trappist]] Abbey of [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] in 1856. The abbey had, since 10 December 1836, brewed a [[witbier]] that was quite sweet and light in alcohol for consumption by the paters. The new beer, however, was a strong version of a brown beer. In 1926, the formulation was changed and it became even stronger. The first written record of its sale by the abbey was on 1 June 1861&lt;ref&gt;Jef van den Steen, ''Trappist - Het Bier en de Monniken'' ISBN 90-5826-214-6, pages 33 &amp; 41&lt;/ref&gt;. Following World War Two, abbey beers became popular in Belgium and the name &quot;dubbel&quot; was used by several breweries for commercial purposes.

Westmalle Dubbel was imitated by other breweries, Trappist and secular, Belgian and worldwide, leading to
the emergence of a style. Dubbels are now understood to be a fairly strong (6%-8% ABV) [[brown ale]], with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character.

[[Chimay]] Red/Premiere, Koningshoeven/[[De Koningshoeven Brewery|La Trappe]] Dubbel and [[Achel]] 8 Bruin are examples from Trappist breweries. [[Affligem]] and [[Grimbergen]] are Belgian [[abbey beer|abbey breweries]] that produce dubbels.
[[Ommegang]] and [[New Belgium Brewing Company|New Belgium]]'s Abbey Ale are examples from the [[USA]].

'''Oud Bruin''', also known as '''Flanders Brown''', is a style of [[beer]] originating from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] region of [[Belgium]].  The Dutch name literally translates as &quot;old brown&quot;, referring to the long aging process which can take up to a year. It undergoes a secondary fermentation, which takes several weeks to a month, and is followed by bottle aging for several more months.  The extended aging allows residual [[yeast]] and [[bacteria]] to develop a sour flavor characteristic for this style. While some examples of an Oud Bruin may be aged in oak, typical  beers in this style are not, and this is what helps Flanders Brown ales distinguish themselves from the more sour [[Flanders red ale|Flanders Red]] ales.

This style of beer is medium bodied, reddish-brown, and has a gentle malty flavor and no hop bitterness. The aroma is a complex mixture of fruits and estery smells of plum, raisin and cherry. The flavor is sweet, caramel, fruity, tart, and slightly acidic, caused by various bacteria in the maturation process. In a good example, the tartness is often balanced with a malty character, tasting of toffee and a giving a &quot;sweet-and-sour&quot; impression. Commercial versions may mix aged beer with younger, sweeter beer to temper the acidity and create a more complex flavor.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jackson &quot;The Great Beers of Belgium&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High gravity beer''' refers to specialty [[beer]] either [[Microbrewery#Craft beer|craft beers]] or [[malt liquor]]s with an increased specific [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|gravity]]. A beer with an original gravity 1.070 is generally considered to be high. High gravity beers are a traditional expression of beer making in [[Europe]], but only a small percentage of [[Microbrewery|microbreweries]] in the [[United States]] produce them. They may be more expensive than [[Mass production|mass-produced]] beer due to larger amounts of high quality grains or malt used, or in the case of malt liquor lower in cost or equal to other mass-produced beers, and full of more filler grains or [[adjuncts]]. They may be more flavorful, intended to be sipped and savored, and are often [[Wine and food matching|paired]] with carefully prepared foods, or in the case of high gravity malt liquor, they may sacrifice some flavor for an inexpensive boost of alcohol level, and may be paired with [[junk food]].

==Alcohol content==
High gravity beer tends to have higher [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] compared to other beers due to the concentration of [[sugar]] and flavor-enhancing ingredients at the beginning of the brewing process. Steel Reserve, one example of a high gravity lager beer contains 8.1% alcohol.

'''Sour beer''' is a [[beer style]] characterized by an intentionally acidic, tart, [[sour]] taste. It is Category 17 of the [[Beer Judge Certification Program]] Style Guidelines. In theory any style of beer may be soured, but in practice the most common styles that are soured are Belgian [[lambics]], [[gueuze]]s, and [[Flanders red ale]].

==Brewing==
Unlike traditional beer-brewing, which is done in a sterile environment to guard against the intrusion of yeast,&lt;ref name=&quot;KochAllyn2011&quot;/&gt; sour beers are made by allowing yeast strains or bacteria into the brew.  Traditionally, Belgian brewers allowed wild yeast to enter the brew naturally through the barrels – an unpredictable process that many modern brewers avoid.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;/&gt; The most common agents used are [[Lactobacillus]], [[Brettanomyces]], and [[Pediococcus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KochAllyn2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greg Koch|author2=Matt Allyn|title=The Brewer's Apprentice: An Insider's Guide to the Art and Craft of Beer Brewing, Taught by the Masters|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1jGevsGvo9MC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=11 September 2011|date=1 October 2011|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=978-1-59253-731-0|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method for achieving a tart flavor is adding fruit – most commonly cherries (to produce [[kriek]]) or raspberries (to produce [[framboise]]) – during the aging process, to cause a secondary fermentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Papazian2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlie Papazian|title=The complete joy of homebrewing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=errBZJY1KdIC&amp;pg=PA346|accessdate=11 September 2011|date=11 September 2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-053105-8|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/01/food/fo-sourbeer1 | title=Sour beer? Pucker up | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=September 11, 2011 | author=Lurie, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the uncertainty involved in using wild yeast, the sour beer brewing process is extremely unpredictable. The beer takes months to ferment and can take years to mature.&lt;ref name=&quot;KochAllyn2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greg Koch|author2=Matt Allyn|title=The Brewer's Apprentice: An Insider's Guide to the Art and Craft of Beer Brewing, Taught by the Masters|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1jGevsGvo9MC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=11 September 2011|date=1 October 2011|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=978-1-59253-731-0|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breweries==
Making sour beer is a risky and specialized form of beer brewing, and longstanding breweries which produce it and other lambics often specialize in this and other Belgian-style beers. Established in 1836, one of the oldest breweries still in operation that produces sour beer is the [[Rodenbach Brewery]] of [[Roeselare]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oliver2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrett Oliver|title=The Brewmaster's Table: Discovering the Pleasures of Real Beer with Real Food|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sGz6wEwkBOwC&amp;pg=PA56-IA120|accessdate=11 September 2011|date=21 April 2005|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-000571-9|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today sour beer has spread outside Belgium to include other European breweries and some in the United States, such as the [[Russian River Brewing Company]].
